			 <p>This is sure to be a hot topic for many of us in ed tech spaces. This online publication frames the issue as one between teachers vs parents. For the teachers, it&rsquo;s about eliminating distractions. For the parents, it&rsquo;s about staying in contact with their children in an environment rife with active shooters (e.g. Uvalde ISD&rsquo;s massacre is fresh in our minds).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="read-the-texas-score-card">Read The Texas Score Card</h2>
<p>The publication, The Texas Score Card, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some Texas school districts are implementing policies to restrict students’ cell phone use on campus. Generally, the policies require the phones to be turned off and placed in lockers or locked pouches that can only be opened by a school official.
A state lawmaker plans to file legislation to address the issue statewide.
Advocates say the move removes a major source of distraction in the classroom. Opponents say it interferes with parents’ right to monitor their children. <a href="https://texasscorecard.com/commentary/yall-answered-ban-cell-phones-in-the-classroom/"><strong>(source)</strong></a></p>

<p>Curious about the latest on this, I queried <a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4"><strong>Perplexity.ai:</strong></a> for a 3-2-1 and the scientific consensus on the topic. What it revealed appears below. What are YOUR thoughts, your opinion?</p>
<h2 id="my-prompt">My Prompt</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the prompt I submitted to <a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4"><strong>Perplexity.ai:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do recently published studies say about banning smartphones in K-12 classrooms? Give me a 3-2-1 (3 facts, 2 quotes, 1 question) about the subject. Also, include the response, &ldquo;What is the scientific consensus on smartphone use in the classroom to distract students from learning and/or its effectiveness compared to traditional paper-n-pencil methods?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The results are split up into two components:</p>
<ul>
<li>3-2-1 Summary</li>
<li>Scientific consensus</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, take a moment to look at the results.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-1-summary">3-2-1 Summary</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a 3-2-1 summary on banning smartphones in K-12 classrooms based on recent studies:</p>
<h3 id="3-facts">3 Facts:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A 2024 UNESCO study recommends banning smartphones in schools for students of all ages, citing improved academic performance and reduced bullying in countries that enforce restrictions[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of 2020, 77% of U.S. schools had moved to prohibit cellphones for nonacademic purposes[3].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies show that it can take up to 20 minutes for a student&rsquo;s brain to refocus on learning after using a smartphone in class[2].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-quotes">2 Quotes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;High school teachers are especially likely to see cellphones as problematic. About seven in 10 (72 percent) say that students being distracted by cellphones is a major problem in their classroom&rdquo;[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The human brain is incapable of thinking more than one thing at a time. And so what we think of as multitasking is actually rapid-switch-tasking. And the problem with that is that switch-tasking may cover a lot of ground in terms of different subjects, but it doesn&rsquo;t go deeply into any of them&rdquo;[3].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-question">1 Question:</h3>
<p>How can schools balance the potential safety benefits of allowing students to have phones (e.g., during emergencies) with the academic benefits of banning them?</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-scientific-consensus-on-smartphones-in-the-classroom">What&rsquo;s the Scientific Consensus on Smartphones in the Classroom?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientific consensus generally supports the idea that smartphones can be significant distractions in the classroom, potentially hindering learning. Multiple studies have shown that smartphone use during class is associated with lower academic performance and reduced attention[1][2][3].</p>
<p>However, the effectiveness of smartphones compared to traditional paper-and-pencil methods is more nuanced. Some research suggests that when used purposefully for educational activities, smartphones can enhance learning experiences[4]. For instance, they can provide quick access to information, facilitate collaborative learning, and offer interactive educational apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That said, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the majority of evidence points to smartphones being more of a hindrance than a help when it comes to classroom learning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The ability of smartphones to distract students from the lesson at hand, through notifications, social media, or other non-academic uses, often outweighs their potential benefits[1][2].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the effectiveness can vary depending on how smartphones are integrated into the curriculum and how their use is managed in the classroom. Some experts advocate for teaching students how to use smartphones responsibly rather than implementing outright bans[3].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, while smartphones can have some educational benefits when used intentionally, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scientific consensus leans towards limiting their use in classrooms due to their significant potential for distraction and negative impact on learning outcomes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>Summary by Perplexity.ai</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amle.org/just-did-some-professional-development-now-what/"><strong>The article &ldquo;Just Did Some Professional Development – Now What?&rdquo; by Rick Wormeli, hosted on the AMLE website</strong></a>, outlines several strategies educators can use to effectively process and apply the content and skills acquired during professional development (PD) sessions. Here are the key strategies mentioned:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Reflection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time to reflect individually on the new information and how it can be integrated into current teaching practices.</li>
<li>Consider journaling or note-taking to document thoughts and insights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the new strategies or techniques in the classroom as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Start with small, manageable changes to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relate the new knowledge to existing practices and curriculum.</li>
<li>Identify areas where the new information can enhance or complement current methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conversation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in discussions with colleagues about the PD experience.</li>
<li>Share insights and strategies, and seek feedback from peers to refine implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, educators can ensure that the professional development they participate in translates into meaningful and effective changes in their teaching practices.</p>

<p>“…the correct analogy for the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting” (Plutarch).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assessment in the face of AI continues to be such a huge concern. This article suggests assessment has been flawed from the beginning and relying on the most convenient approach. That approach is now obsolete as the result of AI.</p>
<p>Instead, put effort into finding evidence that learning has occurred….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>instead of trying to find evidence to prove that cheating has occurred in the production of an artifact, teachers can now turn their energies towards finding evidence that learning has occurred or, more importantly, that it hasn’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stop-looking-evidence-cheating-ai-start-learning-cath-ellis-h0zzc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;utm_campaign=share_via"><strong>This article by Professor Cath Ellis</strong></a>  leaves me asking, “How exactly are you suggesting that evidence be found?”</p>
<p>A commenter (Francois Stalder) has a similar problem, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are valuable insights on looking for evidence of learning, however we need to move beyond discussions about the topic and propose concrete solutions.</p>
<p>For example, in world languages, focusing on practical methods like oral proficiency interviews and peer review sessions can significantly enhance learning.</p>
<p>Additionally, using conversation clubs, storytelling sessions, writing journals, and collaborative writing projects ensures continuous, practical application of the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those points are a bit more practical. They suggest that the way forward with assessing student learning isn’t about tests and work student can in digital formats. Rather it is in just in time conversations, handwritten notes and scribbles in dialogue with an educator.</p>
<p>That is a fundamental disruption of how assessment has been conducted. With AI, anyone can fake the artifacts, the essays, the researched expressions. More difficult, the just in time conversation and dialogue in handwritten work. But the work of teaching becomes infinitely harder, time-consuming.</p>
<p>As a person who crafts adult learning, my emphasis is on curating content and offering exercises that offers a choice to adult learners. That choice?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn, do the work. If you want the badge or certificate, view the content but skip the work. The choice to learn is always yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With K-16 learners, the choice is taken away by adults who don’t trust young people will make the right decision. But mandatory schooling does not ensure learning…humans have to make their choices, and one of them is to decide to learn.</p>
<p>Somehow, children have to decide to learn  <strong>in spite of AI</strong>. For me, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/28/mind-fire/"><strong>the kindling of a fire</strong></a>, offering a choice to students is where it’s at. Less so finding the evidence. Less at AI detection.</p>
<p>Maybe, I have another think coming.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danfitzpatrick/2024/06/30/chatgpt-forces-universities-to-adapt-or-retreat/"><strong>This piece in Forbes by Dan Fitzpatrick</strong></a> makes some interesting points about assessment, quoting several educators. I admit that I have not given assessment as much thought as I should when considering AI. A simplistic perspective is that we write to learn and think through ideas. If you take a shortcut with AI, skipping the brain work, you are self-sabotaging for short-term gain and setting yourself up for long-term failure.</p>
<p>My view has been that if a student uses AI to skip the learning, then they have hurt themselves. As an educator, I set up opportunities for people to struggle and work through ideas, not to my benefit, but for their’s. Learning is always a choice. Mandatory learning is a failure to engage learners, as well as a failure of students to engage in learning.</p>
<p>The goal of the Forbes article is not only to offer alternative assessments, but also to ensure credentialing remains securely in the hands of a school or university:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The university&rsquo;s aim is to assure students, accreditation bodies and future employers that the grades awarded are a true reflection of students' knowledge and abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A part of me says, “So what?” The graduate will know the work or not. If not, they will eventually fail in their work. Then they will come to the horrified conclusion they wasted their time at university…and learn in earnest or do something else. Policing learning is such a futile effort.</p>
<h2 id="replacing-the-essay">Replacing the Essay</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim Mousel, a kinesiology professor at Lone Star College in Texas, suggests a range of alternatives to traditional essays:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the following approaches could replace a written essay: 
project-based assessments, problem-solving scenarios, oral presentations or debates, collaborative group projects, reflective journals or portfolios, experiential learning assignments, peer teaching or tutoring, creation of original content, interactive simulations or role-playing, and open-ended research projects.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="use-process-writing-for-learning-not-assessment-of-learning">Use Process Writing for Learning, Not Assessment of Learning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“We don&rsquo;t have students write to show us what they&rsquo;ve already learned, but we have them write so that they can learn through a scaffolded process with meaningful feedback.&quot; (Trey Conatser, director of CELT at the University of Kentucky)</p>
<p>This view underscores the importance of the learning process itself, not just the end product.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="portfolios-as-continuous-assessment">Portfolios as Continuous Assessment</h2>

<p>Woohoo, as you can see above, Claude now lets you organize your chat support documents, or whatever you want to call them, into &ldquo;Projects.&rdquo; <a href="https://claude.ai/images/projects-explainer.mp4"><strong>Here&rsquo;s an explainer video from Claude.ai</strong></a> on the subject.</p>
<p>An explanation from Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Projects help organize your work and leverage knowledge across multiple conversations. Upload docs, code, and files to create themed collections that Claude can reference again and again.

<p>This is amazing stuff, and it reminds me a bit of a custom GPT. :-)</p>
<h2 id="ai-in-schools-project">AI in Schools Project</h2>
<p>For fun, I uploaded a few documents about AI in Schools. Claude made it easy to interrogate the content and seek more insights, such as what appears below. No doubt, a long prompt would work well for a Claude.ai Project, and I am looking forward to transferring my long prompts and documents in ChatGPT Plus custom GPTs into Claude Projects and see how that works.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here&rsquo;s a response to a query:</p>
<hr>
<p>Based on the documents provided, here are some key insights about how AI is being used in schools and related trends:</p>
<ol>
<li>Widespread adoption:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>AI usage, particularly ChatGPT, has become significantly more common in schools over the past year.</li>
<li>Around 50% of teachers, K-12 students, undergraduates, and parents report using ChatGPT at least weekly for school-related purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Usage patterns:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teachers primarily use AI for creative ideas, lesson planning, and creating exercises/quizzes/tests.</li>
<li>K-12 students mostly use AI for help with assignments and writing essays.</li>
<li>Undergraduates use AI heavily for studying and test preparation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Positive perceptions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Majorities across all groups (teachers, students, parents) view AI chatbots favorably and believe they have potential to enhance learning.</li>
<li>Many see AI as a valuable tool for helping students learn more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Lack of formal policies:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Most teachers, students, and parents report that their schools do not have formal policies on AI use.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a gap between current unofficial usage and desired guidance.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Teacher perspectives:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teachers see AI&rsquo;s most positive impact as improving student efficiency and productivity.</li>
<li>Many teachers want more training on how to effectively use AI in the classroom.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Student career interests:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>K-12 students are unsure about pursuing AI-related careers, while undergraduates show more interest, especially among men and AAPI students.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>Concerns and challenges:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There are worries about cheating, data privacy, and the broader societal impacts of AI.</li>
<li>Older teachers and those less familiar with AI tend to have more concerns.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>Future outlook:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Majorities across groups expect AI usage in education to increase over the next 5 years.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a general desire for more integration of AI into education, but in a thoughtful, guided manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>These insights highlight that AI is becoming an integral part of education, with generally positive perceptions, but there&rsquo;s a need for more formal guidance and training to maximize its benefits while addressing potential concerns.</p>

<p>For 99 percent of the tenure of humans on earth, nobody could read or write. The great invention had not yet been made.
Except for firsthand experience, almost everything we knew was passed on by word of mouth. As in the children&rsquo;s game
&ldquo;Telephone,&rdquo; over tens and hundreds of generations, information would slowly be distorted and lost.</p>
<p>Books changed all that.
Books, purchasable at low cost, permit us to interrogate the past with high accuracy; to tap the wisdom of our species; to understand the point of view of others, and not just those in power; to contemplate-with the best teachers - the insights, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history. They allow people long dead to talk inside our heads. Books can accompany us everywhere.
Books are patient where we are slow to understand, allow us to go over the hard parts as many times as we wish, and are never critical of our lapses. Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society.

<p>This morning, while reading <a href="https://www.threads.net/@smadlinger/post/C8c4FHauXUl"><strong>this response on Threads</strong></a> on my new, consolidated account, I found myself wondering, &ldquo;How many resources does Perplexity, or Claude or ChatGPT, consume when I ask a simple question, like, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the scientific consensus on XYZ?&rdquo; And, should I even be asking that question and using AI to research it? Then, I imagine a host of similar inane questions being asked at &ldquo;Intro to AI&rdquo; workshops around the globe, not to mention more serious questions that demand even greater processing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-data-centers-power-grids/"><strong>Check out the accompanying article from Bloomberg</strong></a>&hellip;it has some amazing pics and message.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="%5Bwww.levernews.com%5D(https://www.levernews.com)/the-unknown-toll-of-the-ai-takeover/"><strong>The Lever, they ask this probing question:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As artificial intelligence guzzles water supplies and jacks up consumers’ electricity rates, why isn’t anyone tracking the resources being consumed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perplexity.ai suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An AI-powered search query consumes approximately three watt-hours of electricity, which is about 10 times more than a traditional Google search<a href="%5Bwww.levernews.com%5D(https://www.levernews.com)/the-unknown-toll-of-the-ai-takeover/"></a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Generating a single image using a powerful AI model like Stable Diffusion XL can consume as much energy as fully charging a smartphone<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption"></a>.</li>
<li>Text generation tasks using AI models consume less energy than image generation, but still more than traditional text-based services. For example, generating text with AI uses about 0.047 kWh per 1,000 inferences, equivalent to 3.5 minutes of Netflix streaming<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption"></a>.</li>
<li>The energy consumption of AI services is much higher than the energy used for model training. Popular models like ChatGPT can exceed their training emissions in just a couple of weeks of regular use<a href="https://www.techspot.com/community/topics/generative-ai-services-are-truly-spectacular-energy-wasting-machines-says-research.283362/"></a>.</li>
<li>Overall, adding AI-generated answers to all Google searches could potentially consume as much electricity as the entire country of Ireland<a href="%5Bwww.levernews.com%5D(https://www.levernews.com)/the-unknown-toll-of-the-ai-takeover/"></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are sobering facts. A few more questions seem worth asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we balance the benefits of AI technology with its significant energy consumption and carbon footprint? Should we?</li>
<li>What responsibility do AI companies have in ensuring their systems are environmentally sustainable? Should they bear the total cost of this or be subsidized by the government (maybe they are already!)?</li>
<li>Should there be regulations or standards in place to limit the environmental impact of AI development and deployment?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s all worth considering.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-1">3-2-1</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a 3-2-1 summary of the article about the energy consumption of AI-powered search:</p>
<h3 id="3-quotes">3 Quotes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Each time you search for something like &lsquo;how many rocks should I eat&rsquo; and Google&rsquo;s AI &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; tells you &lsquo;at least one small rock per day,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re consuming approximately three watt-hours of electricity&rdquo;[1]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ten times the power consumption of a traditional Google search, and roughly equivalent to the amount of power used when talking for an hour on a home phone&rdquo;[1]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Collectively, de Vries calculates that adding AI-generated answers to all Google searches could easily consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland&rdquo;[1]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-facts">2 Facts:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Google introduced AI-generated summaries to search results in early May 2024[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist, an AI-powered search consumes about three watt-hours of electricity[1].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-question">1 Question:</h3>
<p>Given the significant increase in energy consumption for AI-powered searches, how can tech companies balance the benefits of AI integration with environmental sustainability?</p>

<p>Not sure where I ran into this quote, but what a cool quote it is. Of course, it&rsquo;s a reference to handwriting and all that. Last week, when I started looking for <a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/06/20/putting-claude-sonnet.html"><strong>more information</strong></a> about handwriting, I realized that I had bits of handwriting research scattered across different blog entries. Why not consolidate them for easy reference?</p>

<p>Writing by hand…improves memory and recall of words, laying down the foundations of literacy and learning. In adults, taking notes by hand during a lecture, instead of typing, can lead to better conceptual understanding of material.</p>
<p>“Handwriting is probably among the most complex motor skills that the brain is capable of,” says Marieke Longcamp, a cognitive neuroscientist at Aix-Marseille Université.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gripping a pen nimbly enough to write is a complicated task, as it requires your brain to continuously monitor the pressure that each finger exerts on the pen. Then, your motor system has to delicately modify that pressure to re-create each letter of the words in your head on the page. The relative slowness of the medium forces you to process the information, writing key words or phrases and using drawing or arrows to work through ideas, she says. “You make the information your own…” via <strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/11/1250529661/handwriting-cursive-typing-schools-learning-brain">National Public Radio</a></strong></p>

<p>Typing on keyboards has largely replaced writing by hand, even though research shows the latter is better for memory and learning (and for carpal dexterity). Reading in print improves comprehension more than digital text, even though our eyes are fixated on screens these days.</p>

<p>California-based neuroscientist Claudia Aguirre says “more and more neuroscience research is supporting the idea that writing out letters in cursive, especially in comparison to typewriting, can activate specific neural pathways that facilitate and optimise overall learning and language development.”</p>
<p>Kelsey Voltz-Poremba, assistant professor of occupational therapy at the University of Pittsburgh, adds that young children may even find cursive easier to learn and replicate. “When handwriting is more autonomous for a child, it allows them to put more cognitive energy towards more advanced visual-motor skills and have better learning outcomes,” she says. <strong>Source: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240122-california-signs-cursive-writing-into-law-what-are-the-brain-benefits">BBC.com</a></strong>

<p>Someone on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.j.perlman/posts/pfbid0rsG7RTo4BLmNLG5kUPjUcvHiFgnCUfLVEEAvVUWTCLrNSc5Ztbd1BzrwagMbiXFfl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZXUqq1kzkWjzytmkJXndtrJ7kfHL_U_7ot6CCLllmuCdTwpwvKqKt56J15aMyWHCrnDyc-7TW6KC_q6duJatxAHQzyUdQNP-YXL2lIDLTMRzYXpbcwi0Udgzvw5zxf_Ghxv8k6AHPy0Tf2Rvdzo85Joet-N6mRuJMzC2Z-oCYsMHw&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"><strong>Facebook, lauding how wonderful cursive writing</strong></a> is for the brain and how AI cannot read it (which is inaccurate) had someone else ask if a &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; person could test that assertion about AI being unable to read handwriting.</p>
<p>As much as I love <a href="https://mgblog.org/search/?q=handwriting"><strong>handwriting, and using cursive</strong></a> now that I had time to teach myself it again, I didn&rsquo;t think that assertion about AI was right. Two seconds later, I knew it was not.</p>

<p>For fun, I took a page of my handwritten notes (shown above) then dropped them into Claude 3.5 with the prompt appearing below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PROMPT</strong>: Provide the text in the handwritten document attached verbatim. Create a mermaid chart showing key ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result? Pretty cool. Before when Claude was asked to provide diagrams, it could not. Now, it&rsquo;s able to render the code in a snap:

<p>What&rsquo;s more, you can see the code, too:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To edit the code, you&rsquo;ll have to tell Claude what you want change, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make graph LR (left to right) rather than TD (top down)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what that looks like:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Pretty amazing. I&rsquo;ll have to try a few other things out with Claude.ai, and check to see if Perplexity.ai CAN really channel Claude 3.5 or not. Oh, and I forgot to attribute what book my notes are from&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should I load on my new Windows computer?&rdquo; asked a friend, knowing I would have an opinion. I started to make a list, then realized, I could do one better. In this blog entry, find my list of preferred</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows tools,</li>
<li>Browser extensions, and</li>
<li>iOS smartphone apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to post @mguhlin@zirk.us if you have some suggestions of your own.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-nostalgia">A Bit of Nostalgia</h2>
<p>When I look at this list, I&rsquo;m taken back in time to my Apple //e days, when I had a few 5 and a quarter floppy disks loaded with some of my favorite tools. I took to calling those miscellaneous utilities &ldquo;MISCUT&rdquo; for short. The name stuck, and I grew up with 3.5 inch disks, and USB drives named MISCUT. I even had different numbers assigned to MISCUT media, denoting their function.</p>
<p>At 13 years of age, I had come up with a simple way to organize the world around me. Funny that at 55+ years of age, I&rsquo;m still relying on that system.</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Railroad Regulation Act (1887)</strong>: While this act regulated railroads, it did not slow innovation in the industry. Railroads continued to expand and improve, and the act helped to establish standards for safety and fair business practices.</li>
<li><strong>Motor Vehicle Act (1906)</strong>: This act regulated the automobile industry, but it did not slow innovation. The industry continued to grow and evolve, with improvements in safety, design, and technology.</li>
<li><strong>Air Commerce Act (1926)</strong>: This act regulated the aviation industry, but it did not slow innovation. The industry continued to grow and evolve, with improvements in safety, design, and technology.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)</strong>: This act regulated computer crime, but it did not slow innovation in the computer industry. The industry continued to grow and evolve, with improvements in hardware, software, and the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Communications Decency Act (1996)</strong>: This act regulated the internet, but it did not slow innovation. The internet continued to grow and evolve, with improvements in speed, accessibility, and online services.</li>
<li><strong>AI Act (proposed, 2023)</strong>: The impact of this proposed legislation on AI innovation is yet to be determined.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (2008)</strong>: This act regulated genetic engineering, but it did not slow innovation in the field. Genetic engineering continued to advance, with improvements in medical research, agriculture, and biotechnology.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulations (2016)</strong>: These regulations slowed innovation in the drone industry, as they imposed strict rules on drone usage and required extensive testing and certification.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles Act (proposed, 2020)</strong>: The impact of this proposed legislation on autonomous vehicle innovation is yet to be determined.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrency Act (proposed, 2020)</strong>: The impact of this proposed legislation on cryptocurrency innovation is yet to be determined.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, legislation can have both positive and negative effects on innovation. While regulations can provide necessary safeguards and standards, they can also create barriers to entry, increase costs, and slow the pace of innovation.</p>

<p>This piece about AI in education is one I find myself agreeing with. Whether you call it “friction” or “productive struggle,” there IS value in the experience of learning slow.</p>
<p>Consider these quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question has left me wondering if in our pursuit of reducing the time it takes to do things, we’ve forgotten to consider the value of the experience we gain in the time it takes to do them.
…as I look at a hard task done well, I feel good — more alive somehow. I know…myself better.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a term I love that gets at this idea.“Meraki” is a Greek word that describes “doing something with soul, creativity, or love — when you put ‘something of yourself’ into what you’re doing.”
I find it interesting that so many of the things I’ve learned that matter to me the most were hard. They took effort. They took time. Learning them was rewarding.
via <strong><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2024-06-17-ai-might-save-teachers-time-but-what-is-the-cost">Evi Wusk, EdSurge</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wusk cited several examples, gardening among them. Each requires time and effort. You learn something, do it, reflect. The work is hard, unpleasant, uncomfortable. You wish there was an easier way.</p>
<p>Yet, later, you derive a feeling of accomplishment from it. The experience becomes a part of who you are, you grow in wisdom as a result depending on what lessons you distill.</p>
<p>Without that experience, it would mean little to you. AI may take that away or not. It depends on whether you are wise enough to embrace the experience, or give the opportunity away.</p>

<p>I have to agree with this assessment from PEN America of this act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A narrow ideological viewpoint is reshaping student education for students across our public school system,” Meehan told the Guardian. “I think what we’re seeing is a really targeted campaign to increasingly burden and cause confusion and chaos amongst our public school system, in a way that begins to strain and dismantle it.”</p>

<p>Is it safe to say, without evidence, that most writers don’t write for the pleasure alone, but for money? And if they write for money, as part of their work or to publish, then their end goal is financial remuneration, so they can make a living wage? (No, no it is not…see note at the end of this piece).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, is it not unrealistic to expect any student that knows that to write in the way suggested below?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the advent/rise of AI changes nothing about the basics of teaching writing. If you create a community of writers with writing as the centerpiece of your work together then you will reduce the lure of AI. If you regularly engage the writers in your care in authentic writing then you will lower the temptation to fall down the path of AI.
If you show your students how to be writers engaged in real writing tasks by being their guide on this journey then you may just save your students from falling prey to AI. (Source: <a href="https://metawriting.deannamascle.com/teaching-writing-in-the-ai-era/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=teaching-writing-in-the-ai-era"><strong>Deanna Mascle, Metawriting</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like wishful thinking. Three out of four workers don’t write because of a community of writers or the joy of publishing. They write to a deadline and will use whatever means necessary to get that writing done. They are desperate to write because they must produce copy that is good enough.</p>
<p>**<a href="%5Bwww.litandtech.com/2024/06/r...%5D(http://www.litandtech.com/2024/06/revising-from-ai-created-essay-draft.html)">Jen Roberts does the opposite**</a> of what the author, Deanna Mascle, in that quoted piece above suggests or at least does something she disagrees with. Her approach is a bit more realistic.</p>
<p>Still, I want Deanna’s point to be true. I taught writers in my own writing workshop for fifth graders in Cotulla, Tx. My first year of teaching when I knew nothing except writing workshop and ignored my mentor teacher and the grammarians on my grade level. It was magical.</p>
<p>The conditions for it never arose again. The reason why was curriculum and instruction demands, top-down mandates, and later, the micro-management of teaching. And I became a different teacher.</p>
<p>That is why Jen Roberts approach will succeed while the other will fail to materialize, like waiting on fantasy unicorn to appear given the right conditions.</p>
<p>But, if I could,  I would cast aside the reality of AI and write for pleasure, the sharing circle, and jam a shoe in the machinery of publication for social media mongering.</p>
<h2 id="note">Note</h2>
<p>An AI’s conclusion about my opinion in paragraph one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the evidence does not support the claim that most writers write primarily for money over personal pleasure or satisfaction. The sources suggest writers have a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, with making a living wage from writing being difficult for the majority. Claiming money alone is the primary motivation for most writers would be an overstatement not well-supported by the research provided.</p>

<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<p>Some key points from the article as identified by Claude.ai; my comments follow as quoted text:</p>
<ol>
<li>AI might replace professors in many college courses by 2030. It will start as an assistant, then become a co-teacher, and finally take over completely.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see this happening already, right? AI is already an assistant. Once given physical form or a consistent way to interact with students via a Learning management system, co-teaching won&rsquo;t be too far behind&hellip;after that, it&rsquo;s really about improving the presence of the AI in the classroom, which will happen incrementally.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Students want instant help and support, even late at night. AI can provide this, while human professors can&rsquo;t. This is one reason why AI teaching might become popular.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the great benefits of AI&hellip;that it can provide support when humans can&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Professors think AI can&rsquo;t replace them because it lacks human knowledge and relationships with students. But this underestimates what AI can do. What matters is what students want, not what professors think.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The highlighted portion above is what is most important to keep in mind. Professors are married to their way of doing things, but students don&rsquo;t care. They want to get what they want (presumably, a degree that translates into money for them) and then graduate to more money earning possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>To slow down AI taking over teaching, professors should focus on critical thinking, hands-on learning, connecting with students, and not using AI tools to help with grading, making slideshows, etc.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree with this assertion. Professors need to jump into the mix. Resistance, to quote Star Trek&rsquo;s Borg, may be futile, but it&rsquo;s futile because it offers a better, more efficient way of getting things done (at least, from the students' perspective). Does that mean professors will be out of a job? Possibly, but I doubt it. My experience with technology is that it simply changes things, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you won&rsquo;t be needed. It DOES mean re-training for professors in their teaching role&hellip;but what professor wouldn&rsquo;t want more time to generate new ideas and research for consumption by the AI overlords? Hmm&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>AI teaching could save money for colleges and help more students. But it&rsquo;s risky for professors' jobs and might make education worse in some ways. Professors should be careful about letting AI into their classes.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Given how much money Big Tech is bringing to the equation, AI is an unstoppable force. Those professors who don&rsquo;t want AI will lose their jobs or get kicked out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t have any research or evidence to support my opinions, half-baked and typed up in slow, human fashion over the course of 10 minutes. The truth might be scarier or so different as to defy prediction.</p>
<p>Off to pop some popcorn&hellip;the question bugging me? What&rsquo;s the K-12 version of this?</p>

			 <p>While I certainly understand why any organization or business wants its employees to do their work <strong>in the office</strong>, we continue to miss the lesson COVID-19 taught us. That lesson is that NOT driving to work, occupying office buildings, saves so much energy, time, and money (see more graphs below).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With the push to bring everyone back into the office, that means that businesses make MORE money from people when they drive into work, polluting the environment, and spend time in their buildings rather than their homes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my take? Businesses, schools, universities, organizations ALWAYS do what is in THEIR best interest. That &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; is usually decided by someone in charge who gets a kick out of having everyone in one place. Centralized control. We now know that remote work has its own benefits, and continuing to rely on past ways of gathering people is nothing more than control via paycheck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been that, but now, the facade has been stripped away.</p>

<h2 id="return-to-on-site-work">Return to On-Site Work</h2>
<p>Consider the announcement from The University of Texas at Austin president:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning this fall semester, the University will require almost all staff members to work on site full time. . .Staff members can <strong>most effectively serve</strong> our students, faculty, fellow staff members, and other stakeholders <strong>when working together</strong> in an environment that <strong>fosters collaboration, innovation, availability, and reliability</strong>. (<a href="https://president.utexas.edu/2024-messages-speeches/return-site-work"><strong>source</strong></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While those kinds of assertions may have held up in the past due to the employer&rsquo;s authority, today, we have access to AI. Let&rsquo;s see what <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Scientific-Consensus-on-TQI2eg_8S6Syi1K.6liyWg"><strong>Perplexity AI says</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="ai-on-remote-work">AI on Remote Work</h2>
<p>The scientific consensus on remote work is nuanced and reflects a range of findings that highlight both benefits and challenges. Assertions like &ldquo;Staff members can most effectively serve our students, faculty, fellow staff members, and other stakeholders when working together in an environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, availability, and reliability&rdquo; are partially supported by the evidence but also overlook some of the advantages of remote work.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-remote-work">Benefits of Remote Work</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased Productivity</strong>: Several studies have shown that remote workers can be more productive than their in-office counterparts. This is often attributed to fewer distractions, the ability to work during peak productivity hours, and the elimination of commute time[2][3][10].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Work-Life Balance</strong>: Remote work offers greater flexibility, which can lead to better work-life balance, increased job satisfaction, and improved mental health[1][2][3].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: Both employees and employers can save money. Employees save on commuting and work attire, while employers save on office space and related expenses[2][10].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to a Broader Talent Pool</strong>: Remote work allows organizations to hire talent from a wider geographic area, which can lead to a more diverse and skilled workforce[4][11].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges-of-remote-work">Challenges of Remote Work</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Innovation</strong>: In-person collaboration is often cited as more effective for fostering innovation and creativity. Studies have shown that face-to-face interactions can lead to more spontaneous idea exchanges and stronger team bonds[6][16]. The &ldquo;water cooler&rdquo; moments and unplanned interactions that occur in an office setting are difficult to replicate virtually[6][16].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Barriers</strong>: Remote work can lead to communication challenges, especially in terms of synchronous communication. This can result in more siloed work and less effective collaboration[8][14].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Professional Development and Mentorship</strong>: Remote work can hinder professional development opportunities and mentorship, particularly for younger or less experienced employees who benefit from direct feedback and guidance[5][8].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work-Life Boundaries</strong>: While remote work can improve work-life balance, it can also blur the boundaries between work and personal life, leading to longer working hours and potential burnout[1][10].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hybrid-work-as-a-middle-ground">Hybrid Work as a Middle Ground</h3>
<p>Many organizations are adopting hybrid work models to balance the benefits of remote work with the advantages of in-person collaboration. Hybrid work combines remote flexibility with the opportunity for face-to-face interactions, which can enhance productivity, job satisfaction, and innovation[5][11].</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The assertion that staff members can most effectively serve stakeholders in an environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, availability, and reliability is partially true. In-person work environments do offer unique benefits for collaboration and innovation. However, remote work also provides significant advantages in terms of productivity, work-life balance, and cost savings. The optimal work arrangement often depends on the specific needs and goals of the organization, as well as the nature of the work being performed. A hybrid model may offer the best of both worlds, combining the strengths of remote and in-person work[5][11].</p>

<p>This was an interesting article that dealt with more than AI’s impact on the environment. See included table for what other topics. For now, I found this the most compelling.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-environment">Impact on Environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>AI is reliant on a chain of extractive processes that are resource-intensive and with deleterious planetary consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, the growing use of AI technologies in education comes at considerable environmental cost – implicated in the depletion of scarce minerals and metals required to manufacture digital technologies, massive amounts of energy and water required to support data processing and storage, and fast-accumulating levels of toxic waste and pollution arising from the disposal of digital technology (see Brevini, 2021).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Given all the above, any enthusiasms for the increased use of AI in education must address the growing concerns among ecologically-concerned commentators that it might not be desirable (and perhaps even impossible) to justify the development and use of AI technologies in the medium to long-term.

<p>Anyone who read Stoic philosophy knows about &ldquo;The Painted Porch.&rdquo; Not <a href="https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/10/03/athens-day-one-the-stoa-poikile/"><strong>THAT painted porch that gave stoicism its name</strong></a>, but Ryan Holiday&rsquo;s fount of Stoic philosophy and wisdom, <a href="https://www.thepaintedporch.com/"><strong>a book shop</strong></a>. I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to visit yet, even though I live in Texas, but it&rsquo;s on my to-do list. Ryan Holiday publishes a newsletter, and I was delighted to see this excerpt appears in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with our thoughts is that they’re often wrong—sometimes preposterously so. Epictetus said we had to put our impressions to the test, to really look at them, so they don&rsquo;t lead us astray or into embarrassment.</p>
<p>People who say “you’ve got another thing coming” are, in fact, demonstrating the need to follow both Epictetus’ advice and the advice of the expression because the proper expression is actually, “you’ve got another think coming.”</p>
<p>All of us could use a second think from time to time. When we think we know something, when we think we’ve understood, that’s when we get into trouble. What we need to do is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>listen better, ask questions, do a little research, be willing to be corrected</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Our mind is not always our friend, as we said recently. We must trust it but always verify. (Source: <a href="https://dailystoic.com/youve-got-another-think-coming/"><strong>Ryan Holiday, Daily Stoic Emails</strong></a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-process-of-another-think">The Process of Another Think</h2>
<p>When I read the highlighted in yellow portion above of Ryan&rsquo;s words, I am reminded of Melanie Trecek-King&rsquo;s wonderful writings. Consider these quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Science is a process designed to correct for our limited perceptions and flawed thinking.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Melanie offers these six questions to find out if what you believe is true:</p>
<ol>
<li>How sure are you that the belief is true?</li>
<li>What is the source of the belief?</li>
<li>What are your reasons for believing it&rsquo;s true?</li>
<li>How could you figure out if it&rsquo;s true?</li>
<li>How would you feel if you were wrong?</li>
<li>What evidence would change your mind?</li>
</ol>
<p>Scientists, she says, <em>set out to disprove their explanations. The process of systematic disconfirmation is designed to root out confirmation bias.</em> She offers these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify</strong>: Determine the theory or belief that needs to be tested.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesize</strong>: Formulate expectations</li>
<li><strong>Collect</strong>: Gather evidence or data relevant to belief.</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong>: Contrast evidence against initial expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Disconfirm</strong>: Identify evidence that contradicts or challenges the initial belief or theory.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong>: Examine the disconfirming evidence to understand its implications.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust</strong>: Modify the original belief or theory based on the analysis of disconfirming evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>: Continue the process iteratively to refine the belief or theory further.</li>
</ol>
<p>A short time ago, I had <a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/12/be-sure-to.html"><strong>fun taking the process Melanie describes above and trying to shorten it for younger learners</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-quote">The Best Quote</h2>
<p>I suppose one of the reasons I like to read Trecek-King&rsquo;s work is that you run across gems like this one:</p>

<p>Determine if belief is falsifiable. If it is, actively look for evidence to prove yourself wrong.
If belief is true, it will withstand scrutiny.
If not true, evidence will disprove it.
Accept the evidence, and <em>change your mind</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s that last step that everyone has trouble with. <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html"><strong>Cognitive dissonance</strong></a>, when a person is &ldquo;confronted with evidence yet remain convinced of the truth of their beliefs, even more than before,&rdquo; is a the problem. This is due to how we&rsquo;re raised.</p>
<p>A personal example of cognitive dissonance&hellip;For example, when I eat donuts (behavior) and I know that it causes or result in diabetes (cognition) over time, I am in a state of cognitive dissonance. Or a delicious plate of Chinese food laden with salt (behavior) raises my blood pressure and has a deleterious effect on health. So, accepting the evidence is easy&hellip;changing your behavior is hard as heck.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-are-raised">How We Are Raised</h2>
<p>Growing up, I was taught that the wisdom of the world is foolishness. Here&rsquo;s the relevant Scriptural quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For what the world says is wisdom is actually foolishness in God&rsquo;s eyes. As it is written: The cleverness of the know-it-alls becomes the trap that ensnares them (1 Corinthians 3:19).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt, Saint Paul was referring to a different situation in his time and place. What I mean to point out is that quotes like that quotes like that one get taken out of context. Charlatans use them to give credence to their exhortations. As a young man, inculcated in religious tradition, I hearkened to those teachings as a way of dismissing the thinking, the real critical thinking, done by scientists and folks like Bertrand Russell.</p>
<p>And, yes, I was wrong to ignore them. If I had stepped off the path I&rsquo;d been put upon, I would have, for lack of a better term, achieved enlightenment sooner. That is, begun to learn and use systematic disconfirmation to guide my thinking, life, and work. But there was a strong inducement to NOT do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person is responsible for an action if what occurred was what he intended, if he was consciously aware of the circumstances under which he acted, and if the choice was not made in ignorance of them&hellip;the real test of a choice is its actual implementation in the world, and it is for that, that one is held accountable. A central lesson of critical ethics is that people can learn from their mistakes and modify their conduct in the future. (Source: Paul Kurtz, <strong>Forbidden Fruit: The Ethics of Secularism</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="grateful">Grateful</h2>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m grateful that there are so many trying to share critical thinking, from Melanie Trecek-King to Ryan Holiday to the Thinking Clearly podcast. The power of having another think coming means being open to new evidence, of being willing to adjust your position, to change your mind.</p>

<p>This ought to make edtech advocates pause on pushing ebooks into children’s hands…as an avid reader, anecdotally, I can say there is a difference if I don’t take notes by hand in notebook. I prefer nonfiction in print, fiction in digital.</p>
<h2 id="ai-summary">AI Summary</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A study examined how middle-school students understand and process information when reading from digital screens compared to printed pages. Researchers used a brain activity measurement called N400 to see how deeply students were engaging with the text. They found that students read more deeply and understood better when reading from printed pages than from digital screens. 
This was shown by different brain response patterns: deeper reading was linked to stronger brain responses to related words after reading printed text, while shallower reading was linked to weaker brain responses after reading digital text. 
The study suggests that print media may lead to better comprehension than digital media.</p>

<p>What do you think? More guns in schools or not? My opinion is simple.</p>
<p>Given the choice of being unarmed and facing an active shooter, it would be better to be armed. But most active shooters arrive well-armed with assault rifles. Would a pistol be sufficient?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tennessee Passes Bill to Allow Teachers to Carry Concealed Handguns
The move came about a year after the state’s deadliest school shooting and was opposed by some of the families whose children survived the attack.
April 23, 2024 <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/us/politics/tennessee-teachers-guns.html">via The New York Times</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon reflection, my opinion is wrong. We need a better solution than simply implementing a complex solution like arming teachers who signed up to teach not be soldiers in a war.</p>
<p>Or, unwilling dupes of the gun lobby and their cronies.</p>

<p>Wow, this was a tough read for folks who have grown fond of Flip. The shock and surprise are still there, like watching someone desecrate a hallowed place, deface a rock face.</p>
<p>I still remember when I cut Flipgrid (say its name) out my activities. I no longer cared for the direction those who had acquired it were taking it. I still remember the plucky little group of folks that made Flipgrid so great.</p>
<p>Thank you, Flipgrid. Thank you.</p>
<h2 id="the-announcement">The Announcement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For nearly 12 years, amazing educators like you have welcomed Flipgrid and then Flip into your classrooms to empower student voice, creativity and self-expression, and we’re excited to continue our journey together, now inside Microsoft Teams for Education (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams)</a>.
In order to streamline the number of apps educators need to use in their classroom and integrate Flip into more natural assignment rhythms, we have moved some of the core Flip features into Teams for Education and will be retiring our web site and mobile apps by September 30, 2024.
If you are not already using Teams for Education, visit this page (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/education">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/education</a>) and click &ldquo;sign up for free&rdquo;. Once downloaded and set up for your classroom, you can easily share video assignments and messages with students and receive video responses using the Flip camera. This saves educators time having to onboard to Flip outside of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, and it enhances the already rich classroom management toolset available for our Teams for Education users.
Starting July 1, Flip will no longer be available in mobile app stores, and our web site on Flip.com will go into view-only mode. While you will no longer be able to create new groups, topics or videos after this date, you will still have access to download your Flip videos through September 30.
Thank you again, from the bottom of our hearts, for all the great ideas, support and passion you’ve shown for Flip and for all that you do each day to empower future generations. While it’s incredibly hard to say goodbye to our Flip standalone apps, this community has meant the world to us, and we have every intention of continuing on our mission together to empower every learner.
There are exciting new possibilities on the horizon for educators and students, and we look forward to what the future holds!</p>

<p>Making Pages is quite easy. As a <strong>Perplexity Pro user <a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">(get a $10 discount)</a></strong>, I was curious to see what Pages would look like.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so easy! Simply select it as an option, then Perplexity will get to work converting everything into a Pages creation.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s done, you can choose to add media, which will give you a screen like this one:

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>if I could turn a question I had earlier today, <em>Are human brains engaging in serial over parallel processing?</em> My guess had been the former, but less of the latter. Turns out I was wrong. I had another think coming.</p>

<p>The soon-to-be former inhabitants of the island of Carti Sugtupu are the first people in Panama to be displaced by climate change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>via <strong><a href="https://flip.it/0ws7dl">Newswires</a></strong></p>
<p>It cost $12.2 million to put that new community in. How many governments will bother to spend that kind of money for their people?</p>

This course is meant for ages 13 and up. It consists of short video lessons with activities covering 13 topics:
What is an argument in logic?
How arguments can go wrong
Types of arguments - deductive and inductive
Types of sentences - contradictions, tautologies, and contingent sentences
Types of sentence groups - logically equivalent, inconsistent, and consistent
Atomic sentences
Conjunction
Negation
Disjunction

<p>As a pro user of Claude, I didn’t get the memo! Someone should set up a function for that.

<p>Image source: Someone in a Facebook ChatGPT for Teachers group</p>
<p>Great news, right? Custom GPTs will be usable by free users of ChatGPT, those custom GPTs will no longer be behind a paywall. The letter above was shared by an educator who is creating custom GPTs for his K-12 students to use.</p>
<h2 id="can-vs-should">Can vs Should</h2>
<p>Just because you can use a technology in a K-12 classroom, should you? In a blog entry that goes to the hearts of the values mismatch between the mission of schools and AI development fraught with a morass of ethical issues, Tom Mullaney explores the issues.</p>
<h2 id="is-ai-compatible-with-schoolshttpstomemullaneysubstackcompis-openai-compatible-with-school"><a href="https://tomemullaney.substack.com/p/is-openai-compatible-with-school">Is AI Compatible with Schools?</a></h2>
<p>That question is the title of Tom’s blog entry. In it, he asks the question many have been asking as they watch AI tech companies make a run at school funding, a mass charge to bring AI into schools, and charge every person who uses it, at the same time using that data for AI model training.</p>
<p>His blog entry highlights several issues with AI such as equity, racism, bias, copyright, human exploitation, AI lies or hallucinations. To this pile, I would add climate change impact, water usage, destruction of the environment to build massive data centers.</p>
<h2 id="ai-bits-what-are-we-worried-abouthttpstheaienglishteacherwordpresscom20240525ai-bits-episode-2-what-are-we-worried-about"><a href="https://theaienglishteacher.wordpress.com/2024/05/25/ai-bits-episode-2-what-are-we-worried-about/">AI Bits: What Are We Worried About?</a></h2>
<p>Tom isn&rsquo;t the only one with concerns. John Dolman makes a list of concerns, but doesn&rsquo;t go into details, by his own admission. His list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plagiarism and academic dishonesty</strong>. This is on target. Someone tells you not to use AI, you do, and now you have academic dishonesty. It pales in significance to the next bullet, in my opinion [Miguel]</li>
<li><strong>Skill reduction</strong>. This is that ubiquitous, and valid, concern that AI supplants student thinking, resulting in students who can&rsquo;t think their way out of a paper bag, put their thinking down in writing, or use writing to clarify their thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Misinformation</strong>. This is the AI lies, hallucination, factual inaccuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property and Data Privacy</strong>. This is copyright, but also dropping all the privacy data from students, staff, schools into AI could result in information popping up somewhere else and you never know about it.</li>
<li><strong>Equity and access</strong>. We&rsquo;re seeing this already, the fact that Teacher A has access to super-powered, customized AI (e.g. MagicSchool, Diffit, Brisk, Eduaide,Teachaid, etc.) while someone else is using lame, er, Llama, via Meta or struggling along with a free AI. The quality of the responses is markedly different, better on these other solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Pedagogical impact</strong>. What IS the impact on pedagogy and education? Some see AI as the tool to dismantle public education (stuck with bottom tier AIs) while private, charter schools (with deep pockets funded AI tools available to the rich) get the benefit of anything goes AI. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;new arms race&rdquo; for education, and AI is already being &ldquo;weaponized&rdquo; to give advantage to the privileged elite, whomever they might be, over the regular working folks and their kids forced to go to intentionally underfunded public schoo.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental and resource concerns</strong>. You have but to reflect on the environmental impact to know, this is worrisome.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love John Dolman&rsquo;s appeal to all of us to embrace Epictetus or Stoic principles, which I&rsquo;ll quote here for those unfamiliar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice in what you have, cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of your will, make the best of what is in your power and take the rest as it comes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="stoic-wisdom">Stoic Wisdom</h2>
<p>I suspect that many teachers are wishing for the impossible, if they hope to go back to a time without AI and technology. Teachers, everyone who isn&rsquo;t financially independent will find themselves forced to use AI. Only someone with only the most basic needs, a source of income, can hope to embrace Stoic wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has. Remember that it’s not only the desire for wealth and position that debases and subjugates us, but also the desire for peace, leisure, travel, and learning. <em>It doesn’t matter what the external thing is, the value we place on it subjugates us to another</em> . . . where our heart is set, there our impediment lies. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.&rdquo;
-Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick review of those Stoic habits John Dolman refers to:</p>
<h3 id="my-7-habits-of-highly-stoic-peoplehttpstheconversationcomstoicism-and-spirituality-a-philosopher-explains-how-more-americans-search-for-meaning-is-turning-them-toward-the-classics-213440"><a href="https://theconversation.com/stoicism-and-spirituality-a-philosopher-explains-how-more-americans-search-for-meaning-is-turning-them-toward-the-classics-213440">My 7 Habits of Highly Stoic People</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Be self-aware.</li>
<li>Control what you can, let go of the rest.</li>
<li>Practice gratitude, find joy in simplicity.</li>
<li>See obstacles as growth opportunities.</li>
<li>Live in the present, no past regrets or future worries.</li>
<li>Cultivate inner peace against chaos.</li>
<li>Strive for virtue and wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<p>The more I blend AI into my workflow, the more I ask myself, &ldquo;Are these benefits worth the price paid by others, the environment?&rdquo; But then, that&rsquo;s true of EVERY technology that powers modern society, no?</p>
<p>Ok, enough philosophy. Let&rsquo;s get down to brass tacks for educators.</p>
<h2 id="two-more-questions">Two More Questions</h2>
<p>Mike Bell, author of <em>The Fundamentals of Teaching</em>, suggests we ask a tough question when someone says, &ldquo;The research says its effective.&rdquo; In the case of AI, preliminary research is already suggesting it&rsquo;s not effective for student learning. It stunts their brain growth in ways that hamper critical thinking and long-term information retention. More evidence is needed, of course.</p>
<p>Bell&rsquo;s point still applies. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone says, &ldquo;The research says it&rsquo;s effective,&rdquo; ask for the effect size. If it requires a lot of work to implement, and has a low effect-size, pause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the effect size of AI in the classroom? Does it cost a lot of money?</p>
<p>But, of course, that&rsquo;s the opposite of what&rsquo;s going on with AI, right? Every company that can make money from AI adoption in K-16 education is promoting it. How can humanity overcome the engines of its own economy? And, of course, schools can&rsquo;t. They are the tail on the dog, whipped this way and that by whatever catches the attention of a creature with a toddler&rsquo;s attention span.</p>
<h2 id="issues-remain">Issues Remain</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest. AI makes work a lot easier, minimizing the <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/05/27/i-loved-the.html">“friction” of making, organizing, analyzing content</a></strong> . Students need that work to develop their own critical thinking and brain power. Adults focused on making money are willing to use AI. The ethical dilemmas posed by <strong><a href="https://mglinks.org/ai/">AI tools</a></strong> are massive, but <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/05/01/technology-in-schools.html">no different than any other technology</a></strong> (see table of tech and ethical concerns) humans use to the detriment of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Those stakeholders are the workers, the environment, anyone who is exploited.</p>
<p>Some day, there will be a reckoning. And AI, like every other technology will reach a point it is no longer an issue or providing such a fantastic benefit (think of your smartphone), that it won’t matter.</p>
<p>It is an unpleasant truth, but the majority of people in society will use AI, no matter its negative effects. After all, I don’t see anyone making their own clothes a la Gandhi in an effort to stop production.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>

<p>This quote resonates with my own life experiences. At <em>Another Think Coming</em>, I can really see how much ignoring ignorance played into my own life. Everything merits <em>another think</em>. It&rsquo;s almost as if you walk through life with blinders on, and then suddenly, they are gone. And you see everything as it is, or at least, as much as you can see it. From that point forward, you spend time re-examining everything to better understand it, updating your own &ldquo;theory of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="professional-equivalent">Professional Equivalent</h2>
<p>One example that comes to mind is my awareness of Hattie&rsquo;s work. I had no idea his book, or ideas, were available in 2009. Being aware of that would have been SO helpful to me in my career. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t become aware of it until nine years later. That&rsquo;s a lifetime. Worse, at the time, I was so confident of my expertise as an edtech educator, I thought I had the magic bullet. What hubris!</p>
<p>Now, I try to resist the temptation to think, &ldquo;This, THIS is it.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I love Abir Haddoud’s post about the book, so I am reposting it from social media (LinkedIn) below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="quote">Quote</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read  &ldquo;Thinking, Fast and Slow&rdquo; by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It has profoundly changed the way I perceive decision-making and human behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Two Systems of Thinking: Kahneman introduces us to System 1 and System 2</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>System 1: Fast, intuitive, and emotional. It operates automatically with little or no effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System 2: Slow, deliberate, and logical. It requires more mental energy and is used for more complex decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Cognitive Biases: Our reliance on System 1 often leads to cognitive biases—systematic errors in thinking. For example:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anchoring Effect: We rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability Heuristic: We overestimate the likelihood of events based on their recent occurrence in our memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>Prospect Theory: Kahneman&rsquo;s groundbreaking work in behavioural economics shows that people value gains and losses differently, leading to irrational decision-making.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We are more sensitive to losses than gains, a concept known as loss aversion.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Overconfidence: We often overestimate our knowledge and abilities, which can lead to poor decisions. Recognizing the limits of our understanding is crucial for better judgment.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Framing Effect: The way information is presented significantly affects our decisions. For example, we react differently to a 90% survival rate vs. a 10% mortality rate, even though they mean the same thing.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Endowment Effect: People ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This can impact financial decisions and negotiations.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Why It Matters: Understanding these concepts can help us make more rational decisions in our personal and professional lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By being aware of our cognitive biases and the limitations of our thinking, we can strive for better outcomes and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>📚 Recommendation: I highly recommend &ldquo;Thinking, Fast and Slow&rdquo; to anyone interested in psychology, economics, or improving their decision-making skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating exploration of the human mind and a valuable resource for both personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>It’s all about your privacy perspective, isn’t it? Free account? Expect none to little privacy, or whatever suits the vendor. Pro user? A possibility of privacy protection.</p>
<p>Let’s juxtapose Ruben Hassid’s reaction to AI-powered video avatar with Perspective AI’s disclaimer to free users. See anything we should be concerned about?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, ok. Sure, we are all looking for that level of freedom. But there are consequences. This could be a comic right? Me, my AI, and any business who wants to buy my interactions. Oops…data breach?</p>
<p>Does $20 a month REALLY cover it?</p>
<h2 id="perspective-ais-message-to-free-users">Perspective AI’s Message to Free Users</h2>
<p>Here is <a href="https://perspective.technology/">their message</a> to users after you create a free account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you carry on
We&rsquo;re working hard to offer a free option for all your generative AI needs. However, to keep the lights on and provide you with an awesome experience, we need to cover some costs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have two membership options: Free and Pro.</p>
<p>As a Free user, keep in mind that:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your prompts and outputs might be used to train new AI models.
We might sell your prompts and outputs to third parties. Don&rsquo;t worry, we won&rsquo;t share your personal info like email, age, or location - only the inputs and outputs from AI models.</p>
<p>As a Pro user, you get extra perks:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>● Your data, prompts, and outputs are safe with us - we won&rsquo;t sell them to anyone. You&rsquo;re in control - you can cancel your membership anytime.
Note that if your account was created prior to this message, no data will be sold or used.</p>
<p>● Advanced functionalities such as longer context, faster load time, multi model side by side answers and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a perk. I would keep that in mind before telling it everything. Perhaps, it is inevitable. If so, our privacy andvlives are in the hands of people and companies doing everything they can to make money off of us, the consumer.</p>

<p>What are some of the problems with AI in schools? How would you resolve them?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Student&rsquo;s Warning</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A high school student warns you, a school board member, about the potential negative impacts of AI chatbots on student writing. Will you take action to address these concerns, or will you allow AI chatbots to become a permanent fixture in classrooms, changing the nature of student expression?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Crafting AI Policies</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>With no specific state guidance, you and your school district colleagues are racing to finalize the AI policy before the new school year. Will you succeed in creating a comprehensive policy, or will the lack of state direction lead to inconsistent approaches across schools?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>The Role of Turnitin</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Your school district plans to use Turnitin to detect AI-generated content in student work. As the school year begins, will Turnitin effectively safeguard against AI-generated submissions, or will students find ways to bypass the system?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The Future of Student Interaction</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You notice that AI chatbots might alter how students interact, making them overly reliant on algorithms. As the school year progresses, will your students lose their ability to express themselves authentically, or will they find a balance between using AI tools and maintaining their individuality?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>The Cheating Conundrum</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You discover that students are using AI to generate essays, raising concerns about academic integrity. How will you adapt your assignments to prevent cheating?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>The Privacy Predicament</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An AI-powered educational app you recommended collects student data without proper consent. What happens when a data breach occurs?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>The Bias Blunder</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An AI system your school district uses for student assessment exhibits racial bias. How will you address this issue?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>The Addiction Affliction</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You notice that your students are becoming overly reliant on AI-assisted learning tools. What consequences will this have on their critical thinking skills?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>The Misinformation Mayhem</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>AI chatbots provide your students with inaccurate information. How will you combat the spread of misinformation in your classroom?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>The Cyberbullying Crisis</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You discover that your students are using AI to create deepfake videos of their classmates. What steps will you take to prevent this new form of cyberbullying?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>The Equity Enigma</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You realize that AI-driven personalized learning is widening the achievement gap between your advantaged and disadvantaged students. How will you ensure equal access to quality education?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>The Attention Attrition</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The AI-powered educational games you introduced prove too engaging, distracting your students from other crucial learning activities. How will you strike a balance?</li>

<p>I loved this response to an educator’s question about AI use by teachers vs students. It is concise, to the point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a sound rationale for discouraging your students from using A.I. to draft their essays. As with many other skills, writing well and thinking clearly will improve through practice.</p>
<p>By contrast, you already know how to grade papers; you don’t need the practice.
via <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/magazine/ai-essays-grading-ethics.html?smid=li-share">New York Times Magazine</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion here is that a worker who knows how to do a task may benefit from getting AI to take the repetitiveness and drudgery out of the task. How often does drudgery spur innovation?</p>
<h2 id="it-is-all-about-friction">It is all about Friction</h2>
<p>It reminds me about another piece I read earlier this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ChatGPT is at odds with what education is for</em>
OpenAI wants generative artificial intelligence to <strong>reduce friction in our lives. But in the classroom, friction is often the point.</strong> …a tool capable of reducing (or eliminating) the friction that makes thinking, writing, and problem-solving challenging is often going to be at odds with the messy and difficult process of learning….I don’t assign summary and analysis because I need more summaries or analyses; I assign these projects because I want to help my students think through complex ideas and grapple with them. And I don’t ask my students to write papers because the world needs more student papers; I assign papers because I want my students to go through the process of figuring out what they think. <em>The friction is the point.</em>
via <strong><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/22/opinion/chatgpt-gpt4o-demo-education/">The Boston Globe</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the challenge is that it has gotten a lot easier to avoid friction at work AND school.</p>
<p>At work, the expectation is to use AI since you are expected to already know how to do something you are asking AI to do. The power to innovate faster is in your hands. Work doesn’t care if you learn, only that you produce. Learning something at work is a by-product of getting the job done, this attitude suggests. Should it be?</p>
<h2 id="workers-have-to-learn">Workers Have to Learn</h2>
<p>If your boss says “Do this,” and you don’t know how, you have to learn. Your boss may send you to get trained or not, it’s up to them.</p>
<p>But if you learn what you need to on your own, then complete the task, you got a benefit greater than a paycheck. You also can leave at any time…you don’t owe your boss or org anything because they got what they wanted—the product they put you in a room to make, often without straw a la Rumpelstiltskin tale.</p>
<p>In the end, you are an adult who has control of what and how they learn.</p>
<h2 id="student-learning">Student Learning</h2>
<p>At school, as a student learner, the whole point of the experience is training minds to think. The product isn’t the desired outcome. <em>To the extent an end product is your measure of success, the greater the disruption AI will cause in your classroom.</em> The more the focus is on tracking growth from making your brain work, the less disruption AI will cause.</p>
<p>What matters is what you did that changed your brain. That moved you from <a href="https://www.mglead.org/materials/ebs/ebs-strategies"><strong>surface to deep to transfer learning</strong></a>. The product is a “nice to have” example of the trip through the learning pit.</p>

<p>You must treasure every bump, bruise, swim across creature-infested bodies of water…because it makes your brain learn more. There are no shortcuts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you reflect on your experience, you deepen the learning.</p>
<h2 id="active-learning">Active Learning</h2>
<p>For me, being an active learner is the point of life. If you are a worker merely producing product, why bother? The best work, in my opinion, is that which allows you to learn new things through a constant flow of unique problems in diverse situations.</p>
<p>Your access to problems and the solutions you develop determine your relevance to others, your value. Of course, you don’t have to share your solutions but that limits their quality.</p>
<p>It is only in public discourse that we find out if the solutions we struggled to put together are worthy of society. The ultimate validation is the replication, the use, of those ideas in other settings, separate from where they were created.</p>
<h2 id="struggle-for-brain-growth">Struggle for Brain Growth</h2>
<p>Student learners must have the opportunity to struggle with ideas, test their value, and share them for public critique, acclamation, or friendly, kind critique. If technology or AI arrests that process, students will rue the day they relied on AI.</p>
<h2 id="our-responsibility">Our Responsibility</h2>
<p>What is our responsibility as adult learners? To model responsible use of AI. That is, to NOT use it when we do something that is unknown to us for which we must learn new things. And, to use it when what is known to us must be seen from a fresh, not necessarily new to the world but novel to us, perspective. Also, to eliminate repetitive tasks, drudgery. Although, to be honest, it is in trying to avoid those that I&rsquo;ve come up with some great workarounds&hellip;innovative workarounds or changes that add value.</p>
<p>What do you think? Grab paper and pen, write it down.</p>

<h2 id="discovering-mermaid">Discovering Mermaid</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, I spent a lot of time on a blog entry for work, focused on creating diagrams, flowcharts using Mermaid code. The STEM aspect of the blog entry, involving Mermaid code (which I had never heard of), captivated me. I had no idea that Mermaid code is code that could be generated by AI to create diagrams, charts, and graphs. I checked, and it appears Mermaid coders can augment their income.</p>

<p>What kills me is how I stumbled on Mermaid in the first place&hellip;via Perplexity results.</p>
<h2 id="stumbling-on-mermaid">Stumbling on Mermaid</h2>
<p>I had asked Perplexity to give me a decision flowchart to pass onto family about whether she should attend an outdoor graduation ceremony in the Texas heat with mosquitos flourishing. Instead of a flow chart, it gave me Mermaid code that resulted in:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Then, I found out you could make this with code. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy with Canva, Slides, PowerPoint, but there was something different (the &ldquo;coding&rdquo;) to make the diagram via Mermaid code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure how Micro.blog will handle the Markdown code below. It would be cool if it rendered the Mermaid code, but it appears to simply treat it as a code block. That&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>In previous blog entries, I shared a list of AI fears. Did those fears have any evidence? This is part 4 where I share the AI fear and an AI&rsquo;s response with AI evidence. Skeptical? Good. I won&rsquo;t mention the problem with confirmation bias, only remind you of Trecek-King&rsquo;s quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We think we follow evidence to a conclusion. In reality, we come to our beliefs in irrational ways, then work backwards to find evidence to rationalize the belief.&rdquo; -Melanie Trecek-King, ThinkingIsPower.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, with that in mind, here&rsquo;s the fear and the AI evidence. In previous blogs, I relied on Perplexity and Claude AIs. In this one, I&rsquo;ll use Meta.ai. (ugh).</p>

<h2 id="fear-3-ai-replaces-peoples-functions">FEAR #3: AI REPLACES PEOPLE’S FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>One of the tough things to comprehend is that AI can replace the work trained professionals do. It can do it effortlessly under the right tutelage and with the right prompts. This means that people’s work product, what they get paid to produce (as opposed to being paid to reason) is easy to replace. With one person and an AI, I may get away with cutting a few other jobs.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to imagine AI robots eventually taking over physical tasks that are dull, repetitive, and which employ low-skilled workers. Worse, we can easily imagine AI using its own power to leapfrog from advancement to advancement to replace jobs that involve creation of some work product.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ais-response">AI&rsquo;s Response</h2>
<p>Here is the information in markdown format:</p>
<h3 id="evidence-of-ai-replacing-peoples-functions">Evidence of AI replacing people&rsquo;s functions</h3>
<p>=============================================</p>
<h4 id="automation-of-repetitive-and-routine-tasks">Automation of repetitive and routine tasks</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Studies have shown</strong> that AI and automation can already perform tasks such as:
<ul>
<li>Data entry</li>
<li>Bookkeeping</li>
<li>Customer service
with high accuracy and speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>According to a McKinsey report</strong>, up to <strong>45%</strong> of work activities can be automated using currently available technology.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ai-powered-tools-and-systems">AI-powered tools and systems</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI-powered tools and systems</strong> are being developed and implemented in various industries, such as:
<ul>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Transportation
to perform tasks that were previously done by humans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, AI-powered diagnostic tools can:
<ul>
<li>Analyze medical images</li>
<li>Diagnose diseases
with high accuracy, potentially replacing some tasks performed by radiologists and doctors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="job-displacement-and-economic-disruption">Job displacement and economic disruption</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>The rise of automation and AI</strong> has been linked to job displacement and economic disruption in various industries, such as:
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute</strong>, automation has been responsible for the loss of around <strong>1.5 million</strong> manufacturing jobs in the United States between 2000 and 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advancements-in-ai-capabilities">Advancements in AI capabilities</h4>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI systems are rapidly advancing</strong> in areas such as:
<ul>
<li>Natural language processing</li>
<li>Computer vision</li>
<li>Machine learning
enabling them to perform complex tasks that were previously thought to be the exclusive domain of humans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, AI-powered language translation tools can now:
<ul>
<li>Translate languages
in real-time, potentially replacing human translators in some contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that while AI has the potential to automate and replace certain tasks and functions, it also has the potential to <strong>create new job opportunities</strong> and <strong>enhance productivity</strong> in various industries. The key is to ensure that workers have the skills and training needed to adapt to an increasingly automated workforce.

<p>In a previous blog entry, I shared a list of AI fears. But, when I ran it through Trecek-King&rsquo;s FLOATER acronym, the AI megaprompt suggested that while well-reasoned, the fears lacked evidence. Of course, it&rsquo;s not that the fears lacked evidence, but that MY original post was missing evidence. This is part 3 where I share the AI fear and an AI&rsquo;s response with AI evidence. Skeptical? Good.</p>
<p>Read the series here:</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/05/17/ai-fears-lacking.html">AI Fears: Lacking Evidence, Part 1</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation Bias</h2>
<p>One of the dangers of AI, and this blog post and subsequent ones may well prove it, is that one starts with the desired conclusion (fear of AI). Then, one uses AI to analyze low quality, incomplete evidence that supports that conclusion in a fit of motivated reasoning (a.k.a. confirmation bias being the main problem). Confirmation bias is simply coming to a conclusion then marshaling evidence and &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; reasoning to support that conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We think we follow evidence to a conclusion. In reality, we come to our beliefs in irrational ways, then work backwards to find evidence to rationalize the belief.&rdquo; -Melanie Trecek-King, ThinkingIsPower.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, with that in mind, here&rsquo;s the fear and the AI evidence. In Part 2 of this blog entry, I relied on Perplexity.ai. In this one, I use Claude.ai.</p>
<p>Is the conclusion merited or not?</p>
<h2 id="fear-2-ai-replaces-the-human-reasoning-process">FEAR #2: AI REPLACES THE HUMAN REASONING PROCESS</h2>
<p>AI will replace critical thinking and reasoning. Learning how to reason is hard work. Then, learning about logical fallacies, how to overcome our own bias, is hard. Reasonign involves following evidence to a logical conclusion. Melanie Trecek-King (Thinking is Power.com) describes it:</p>
<p>Evidence-&gt;Reasoning/Logic-&gt;Conclusion</p>
<p>AI makes it very easy to rationalize, or to select evidence to justify a conclusion. Rationalizing might be described as:
Desired Conclusion -&gt; Motivated Reasoning (confirmation bias) -&gt; Incomplete, low quality evidence</p>
<p>AI makes it a simple matter to construct motivated reasoning with any evidence to reach the desired conclusion. But the fear with students using AI is that students NEVER develop a way of gathering evidence, figuring out what it says, then coming to a conclusion. The reason why is that writing has been the way that’s been done for a long time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ais-response">AI&rsquo;s Response</h2>
<p>There are valid concerns that AI language models like myself could potentially hinder the development of critical thinking and reasoning skills in students if not used thoughtfully. Here is some of the key evidence to consider:</p>
<p><strong>1. Ease of rationalizing desired conclusions:</strong> As you note, AI makes it very easy for students to cherry-pick evidence to support whatever conclusion they want to reach. They can prompt the AI to generate arguments for a particular view, without doing the hard work of gathering and evaluating evidence objectively. This risks reinforcing confirmation bias.</p>
<p><strong>2. Outsourcing the reasoning process</strong>: If students rely too heavily on AI to analyze information and construct arguments for them, they may not fully develop their own skills in logical reasoning, evaluating evidence quality, recognizing fallacies, etc. Learning to reason well requires practice.</p>
<p><strong>3. Potential to skip evidence gathering:</strong> A worry is that students will jump straight to generating a full essay with AI based on their existing views, without first doing a thorough investigation of evidence on the topic. Sound reasoning has to start with comprehensive, high-quality evidence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Impact on motivation to learn:</strong> Some fear students will be less motivated to put in the hard work to develop reasoning capabilities if they can take an &ldquo;easy route&rdquo; with AI. Writing has traditionally been key for building these skills.</p>
<p>However, I would argue that while these are real risks to mitigate, AI can also potentially support critical thinking if used as a tool in the right ways - for example, by helping students more easily see different viewpoints on an issue to analyze, or by critiquing gaps in reasoning or evidence in student writing.</p>
<p>The key is for educators to very intentionally guide AI use as part of the learning process, with the goal of strengthening (not replacing) each student&rsquo;s own thinking and reasoning capabilities. Students still need to be taught and assessed on their information gathering, logical reasoning, and drawing sound conclusions from evidence. AI should be a supplement to this educational process, not a substitute for it.</p>
<p>Proper instruction, support and assessment will be essential to ensure the next generation develops strong critical thinking faculties even in an age of AI assistance. The human reasoning process remains paramount. But AI, used carefully as an educational aid rather than a crutch, has potential to help cultivate these crucial skills. Research and experimentation will be important to figure out the best approaches.</p>

<p>Is that for the US? I know a new hs grad in first year education, and the young man next door just finished his teaching degree. I&rsquo;m not sure how long they&rsquo;ll last as teachers, but no job is perfect. Perhaps a living wage with any student loans being forgiven after 5 years of work would help make it attractive along with a safe work place that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read there&rsquo;s been an increase in harassment against female teachers as boys discover Andrew Tate and other online misogynists. That&rsquo;s something teachers need tools to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at this with the help of AI.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-report-us-centric">Is This Report US-centric?</h2>
<p>This is a pretty easy question to respond to so I asked Perplexity to summarize the response&hellip;I love that it provides the sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the report is U.S.-centric. The sources provided focus on teacher shortages within the United States, examining various states and regions, and discussing national trends and policies related to the teaching profession in the U.S. Here are some key points that highlight the U.S. focus:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>State-Specific Data</strong>: The sources provide detailed information on teacher vacancies and shortages by state, such as Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama[1][2].</li>
<li><strong>National Surveys and Reports</strong>: The sources reference national surveys and reports from organizations like the National Education Association (NEA) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which focus on U.S. public schools[1][3].</li>
<li><strong>Federal Policies and Programs</strong>: The sources discuss U.S. federal policies and programs aimed at addressing teacher shortages, such as the American Rescue Plan and initiatives by the U.S. Department of Education[4].</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Educational Context</strong>: The sources analyze trends in teacher preparation program enrollment and completion within the U.S., and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. public education employment[2][5].</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the report and the sources provided are centered on the context, challenges, and solutions related to teacher shortages in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="rise-in-harassment-against-female-teachers">Rise in Harassment Against Female Teachers</h2>
<p>Cass M also mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read there&rsquo;s been an increase in harassment against female teachers as boys discover Andrew Tate and other online misogynists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen much about this, although I have seen reports of increased violence against teachers and seen some incidents on the evening news in the Texas city where I live. Perplexity summarizes the article aspects dealing with harassment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The provided sources do not specifically address an increase in harassment against female teachers in the United States due to the influence of Andrew Tate or other online misogynists. However, they do provide a broader context of gendered harassment and violence against women in various professional and public roles, which can be extrapolated to understand potential trends in other fields, including education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does provide more detail, but I decided to pose the question a little more generally. Then put the data into ChatGPT 4o for graphs. These make it easier to understand what is suggested.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2024-05-13-what-would-it-take-to-attract-gen-z-to-teaching">In this article, EdSurge asks</a></strong> , how to attract GenZ to Teaching. But the article went on and on&hellip;so a summary of tactics via Perplexity helped cut through the words. I hope you find it useful&hellip;.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-it-take-to-attract-gen-z-to-teaching">What Would It Take to Attract Gen Z to Teaching?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Exposure</strong>: Increase participation in high school teaching courses to cultivate early interest in education.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Implement flexible scheduling, such as late starts or days off, to improve work-life balance.</li>
<li><strong>Support Staff</strong>: Hire additional support staff to provide teachers with planning time and opportunities for professional development.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative Technology</strong>: Integrate innovative technology to make the profession more appealing.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Foster a collaborative work environment to attract Gen Z, who value teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Narratives</strong>: Promote the positive aspects of teaching to counteract negative perceptions and encourage more students to consider the profession.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="er-not-convinced">er, not convinced</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much new or different here. That is, nothing that would make a GenZ jump up and say, &ldquo;Teaching is for me!&rdquo; The research findings are quite a disappointment. One observation is possible&hellip;there&rsquo;s no one factor that will attract GenZ, and the rest are just old solutions. Consider&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Early interest in education. Really? Is &ldquo;catch &lsquo;em when they&rsquo;re young&rdquo; the best option?</li>
<li>Flexible scheduling in the face of traditional school scheduling? Not likely. Schools are daycare for many parents while they work, no matter what amazing things teachers make happen during the day in the face of crazy challenges and expectations.</li>
<li>Support staff. Well, those poor folks are underpaid, overworked, and soon to be unemployed with ESSER funding drying up and Republican legislators seeking to siphon funding to pay for private charter schools.</li>
<li>Innovative technology. We appeared to have a lot of innovative technology during COVID-19, but now the funding that paid for that is disappearing. Perhaps, our commitment for edtech is flagging.</li>
<li>Collaboration. The job of a teacher is solitary, &ldquo;close the door.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not convinced that the school system can be changed to accommodate collaboration, no matter the PLCs, and peer to peer coaching support. We need more radical change that shakes apart Industrial factory model of education.</li>
<li>Positive narratives. This is public relations, about as spurious as fostering early interest in education.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need true reform. Here&rsquo;s one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get rid of politicians interfering in schools
Make sure administrators are instructional, not transformational, inspirational, media glory hounds on their way to next superintendency
Stop pop reforms that have no research
Prohibit technology use that isn&rsquo;t aligned to evidence-based approaches&hellip;by shutting vendors out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, out of time for a morning screed. Lots to ponder here, in terms of reflecting on my own biases and experiences.</p>

<p>In my previous blog entry, I shared a list of AI fears. But, when I ran it through Trecek-King&rsquo;s FLOATER acronym, the AI megaprompt suggested that while well-reasoned, the fears lacked evidence. Of course, it&rsquo;s not that the fears lacked evidence, but that MY original post was missing evidence.</p>
<p>Read the series here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/05/17/ai-fears-lacking.html">AI Fears: Lacking Evidence, Part 1</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation Bias</h2>
<p>One of the dangers of AI, and this blog post and subsequent ones may well prove it, is that one starts with the desired conclusion (fear of AI). Then, one uses AI to analyze low quality, incomplete evidence that supports that conclusion in a fit of motivated reasoning (a.k.a. confirmation bias being the main problem). Confirmation bias is simply coming to a conclusion then marshaling evidence and &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; reasoning to support that conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We think we follow evidence to a conclusion. In reality, we come to our beliefs in irrational ways, then work backwards to find evidence to rationalize the belief.&rdquo; -Melanie Trecek-King, ThinkingIsPower.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, with that in mind, here&rsquo;s the fear and the AI evidence. Is the conclusion merited or not?</p>
<h2 id="fear-1-ai-replaces-student-brain-processing">FEAR #1: AI REPLACES STUDENT BRAIN PROCESSING</h2>
<p>Students will increasingly rely on AI generated creations to get the desired output for a grade.The desired output, the product that represents students’ knowledge, isn’t the real desired end of education. It’s the process students’ brains go through to get to the end product that is graded. AI usage by students jeopardizes this in a way that is indistinguishable from actual work product.</p>
<p>The AI gathered evidence and conclusion appears below the line. Will the citations offered by AI be sufficient to convince you of the accuracy?</p>
<hr>
<p>The concern that AI usage by students might replace critical brain processing and learning is supported by several pieces of evidence from the provided sources. Here are the key points:</p>
<h3 id="loss-of-critical-thinking-and-creativity">Loss of Critical Thinking and Creativity</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-Reliance on AI</strong>: Many educators worry that students who rely heavily on AI tools may develop a lack of critical thinking skills and creativity. This is because AI can provide ready-made answers, which might discourage students from developing their own ideas and solutions. This concern is echoed in multiple sources, highlighting that <em>students might not engage deeply with the material if they can easily obtain answers from AI</em>[2][6][7][14].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decreased Cognitive Development</strong>: <em>Relying solely on AI for writing assignments can compromise students' ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information independently</em>. This over-reliance hampers cognitive development and prevents students from grasping the intricacies of the subject matter[6].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-learning-process">Academic Integrity and Learning Process</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Dishonesty</strong>: <em>The use of AI tools</em> like ChatGPT to generate essays or complete assignments can lead to academic dishonesty. This not only undermines the integrity of the educational process but also <em>means that students are not genuinely engaging with the learning material</em>[1][2][9][14].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misrepresentation of Work</strong>: There is a significant concern that students may misrepresent AI-generated work as their own, which can lead to a false assessment of their understanding and skills. This misrepresentation can be difficult to detect and can undermine the educational process[17][18].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="impact-on-student-teacher-interaction">Impact on Student-Teacher Interaction</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced Human Interaction</strong>: <em>Increased use of AI in education</em> can lead to reduced human contact between students and teachers. This <em>can result in students feeling isolated and disconnected</em>, which can negatively impact their motivation and engagement[4][5][13][14].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias and Misinformation</strong>: AI tools can sometimes provide biased or inaccurate information, which can mislead students and affect their learning outcomes. This can further complicate the educational process and the development of critical thinking skills[2][5][13][14].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="empirical-evidence-and-studies">Empirical Evidence and Studies</h3>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p><strong>Empirical Studies</strong>: <em>Limited empirical studies have shown that AI systems can affect learner-instructor interaction</em> in online learning environments. For instance, AI teaching assistants and automated grading systems can change the dynamics of how students interact with their instructors, potentially leading to a more passive learning experience[4][12].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Survey Data</strong>: Surveys indicate that a significant number of students have used AI tools for assignments or exams, and many believe that this does not constitute cheating. This widespread use of AI tools suggests that students might be bypassing the critical thinking and problem-solving processes that are essential for learning[3].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The evidence suggests that the fear of AI replacing critical brain processing in students is well-founded. The over-reliance on AI tools can lead to a loss of critical thinking and creativity, academic dishonesty, reduced human interaction, and the potential for bias and misinformation. These factors collectively jeopardize the educational process and the development of essential cognitive skills in students.</p>

<p>Wondering if GNU/Linux is worth investigating? Check out retired educator, <strong><a href="https://bob-irving.com/117-2/">Bob Irving&rsquo;s account</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of my peripherals just worked, which is a far cry from what I remember about my earlier forays into linux. Wifi – check. Mouse – check. Keyboard – almost check (bluetooth doesn’t work with grub). Printer – check. Webcam – check minus. Don’t know if that’s a Firefox issue or something else, but I’ve only been able to get it reliably working (Google Meet) on the Windows side with Chrome.</p>
<p>Got backing up working to my Google Drive with rclone. Have to do it manually, and that’s not ideal, but it’s ok for now.</p>
<p>Bought a sub-$100 Thinkpad for my on-the-go machine and put LM on it. Works great, but now I have to come up with a solution for syncing with the desktop, and syncthing is next on my scary list of stuff to set up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been using GNU/Linux off and on for years since a colleague introduced me as a way to rehabilitate old equipment, and run free, open source software like Apache, MySQL, PHP to host websites for work, it&rsquo;s always a bit of a challenge. That&rsquo;s because the experience varies from computer to computer. UEFI is a four letter word (or was for awhile), but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the experience of GNU/Linux on Ubuntu, Peppermint, and variants of those, as well as Linux Mint.</p>
<p>The last is my favorite OS these days, especially on an old Surface (personal) and Lenovo W540 (work, dual boot with Windows 10). While I had to buy a &lt;$30 USB webcam, I can at least use the Surface book as my primary Linux machine.</p>
<h2 id="syncthing">SyncThing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/04/21/moving-files-around.html">mentioned SyncThing before</a></strong>, and it&rsquo;s great. I use it to keep my iOS smartphone in sync with Windows 11 and Linux Mint machines. Set up on all of them was fairly straightforward, although I did have to pay for an iOS app to get the job done.</p>
<p>You know, when I started down this road so many years ago, my goal was simply to get that old HP scanner connected to my obsolete bondi iMac. I&rsquo;m grateful I did.</p>

<p>Someone asked if I might consider serving on a panel discussing AI in K12 education. It occurred to me to ask ChatGPT 4o for a panel script. Since the result was a bit overly positive,  I had to add an oppositional perspective to original output. I wanted to include topics like fears of AI in education, energy needs, climate impact, and economic considerations.</p>
<p>This is the result below&hellip;as I read it, I can&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s missing? How could this have been more real?&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Alamo STEM Ecosystem monthly meeting. Today, we&rsquo;re excited to discuss AI education at the K-12 level, along with some critical considerations regarding its implementation. Our panel includes experts from industry, universities, K-12 education, and an opposition perspective. Let&rsquo;s dive into the discussion. Henry, could you start by telling us about the current state of AI education in K-12 schools?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Henry:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;d be happy to. Right now, AI education at the K-12 level is still in its early stages. While there are some programs and resources available, it&rsquo;s not yet widespread. We need more comprehensive efforts to ensure that students are prepared for an AI-driven future. But as we delve deeper, it&rsquo;s important to consider some of the fears and concerns surrounding AI in education, such as the potential for AI to replace critical brain processing in students.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Industry Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;I agree, Henry. From an industry perspective, we see a huge demand for AI skills in the workforce. It&rsquo;s crucial that we start building these skills early on. One way we can do this is by creating partnerships between schools and tech companies to provide real-world applications and experiences for students. However, we must also address concerns like the environmental impact of AI, its energy consumption, and the per-student cost of AI education tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>University Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Absolutely. At the university level, we&rsquo;ve been working on developing curriculum and resources that can be adapted for K-12 use. For instance, we&rsquo;ve created modules that introduce basic AI concepts through hands-on projects and interactive learning. However, as Melanie Trecek-King points out, confirmation bias can lead us to draw conclusions without robust evidence. AI in education is no exception. The fears that students might rely on AI to the detriment of their critical thinking skills need to be backed by solid evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Opposition Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;While I understand the enthusiasm for integrating AI into K-12 education, I have several concerns. First, there&rsquo;s the issue of equity. Not all schools have the same level of access to technology and resources, which could widen the gap between well-funded schools and those that are under-resourced. Additionally, the energy needs of AI are significant. AI systems require a lot of computational power, which translates to higher energy consumption, increased water usage for cooling, and a substantial carbon footprint. This not only increases costs but also has a climate impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>K-12 Educator:</strong><br>
&ldquo;In the classroom, it&rsquo;s important to balance the benefits of AI with its costs and environmental impact. We can start by integrating AI in ways that maximize its educational value while being mindful of resource usage. This might mean using AI tools selectively and ensuring that we&rsquo;re teaching students about the environmental implications of technology. Also, we need to be wary of over-reliance on AI, which can lead to a loss of critical thinking and creativity among students.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong><br>
&ldquo;These are all excellent points. Henry, how do you see the role of initiatives in addressing these challenges?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Henry:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Initiatives should focus on providing comprehensive resources and training for teachers, ensuring that both educators and students are equipped with the necessary tools and knowledge. Partnerships with industry and universities can bring in expertise and real-world applications that enhance the learning experience. It&rsquo;s crucial to make AI education accessible and engaging for all while considering the environmental and economic impacts. For instance, we should be aware of the per-student cost for AI education tools and strive to make these tools more affordable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Industry Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;My key takeaway would be to seek out partnerships with local tech companies. These partnerships can provide valuable resources and real-world insights that make AI education more relevant and exciting for students. However, we must also work on making AI systems more energy-efficient to mitigate their environmental impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>University Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Mine would be to start small and build on what you have. Integrate AI concepts into existing subjects and gradually expand as you become more comfortable with the material. There are plenty of resources available to help you get started. And always remember to base your conclusions on solid evidence, avoiding the trap of confirmation bias.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>K-12 Educator:</strong><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment and learn alongside your students. AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it&rsquo;s okay not to have all the answers. Embrace the journey of learning together. But also be aware of the ethical and environmental implications of AI use.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Opposition Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;While exploring AI education, always consider the ethical implications and strive for inclusivity. Ensure that all students have equal access to the technology and protect their data privacy at all costs. Additionally, remain aware of the environmental and economic costs and work towards sustainable solutions. Also, be cautious of confirmation bias; ensure that any fears or enthusiasm for AI are backed by robust evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Henry:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Finally, I&rsquo;d emphasize the importance of ongoing professional development. Stay informed about the latest advancements in AI and continuously seek out opportunities to enhance your skills and knowledge. And ensure that any implementation of AI is done responsibly, considering both its benefits and its potential drawbacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong><br>

&ldquo;Mine would be to start small and build on what you have. Integrate AI concepts into existing subjects and gradually expand as you become more comfortable with the material. There are plenty of resources available to help you get started. And always remember to base your conclusions on solid evidence, avoiding the trap of confirmation bias.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>K-12 Educator:</strong><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment and learn alongside your students. AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it&rsquo;s okay not to have all the answers. Embrace the journey of learning together. But also be aware of the ethical and environmental implications of AI use.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Opposition Expert:</strong><br>
&ldquo;While exploring AI education, always consider the ethical implications and strive for inclusivity. Ensure that all students have equal access to the technology and protect their data privacy at all costs. Additionally, remain aware of the environmental and economic costs and work towards sustainable solutions. Also, be cautious of confirmation bias; ensure that any fears or enthusiasm for AI are backed by robust evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Henry:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Finally, I&rsquo;d emphasize the importance of ongoing professional development. Stay informed about the latest advancements in AI and continuously seek out opportunities to enhance your skills and knowledge. And ensure that any implementation of AI is done responsibly, considering both its benefits and its potential drawbacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong><br>
&ldquo;Thank you all for your insights. This has been a very informative discussion. Now, let&rsquo;s open the floor to questions from our attendees.&rdquo;</p>

</ul>
<p>The real fear isn’t that teachers will use AI for themselves to make their work less burdensome, time-consuming. There are several fears in the use of AI in education. Here are the ones I’ve observed.</p>
<h2 id="fear-1-ai-replaces-student-brain-processing">FEAR #1: AI REPLACES STUDENT BRAIN PROCESSING</h2>
<p>Students will increasingly rely on AI generated creations to get the desired output for a grade.The desired output, the product that represents students’ knowledge, isn’t the real desired end of education. It’s the process students’ brains go through to get to the end product that is graded. AI usage by students jeopardizes this in a way that is indistinguishable from actual work product.</p>
<h2 id="fear-2-ai-replaces-the-human-reasoning-process">FEAR #2: AI REPLACES THE HUMAN REASONING PROCESS</h2>
<p>AI will replace critical thinking and reasoning. Learning how to reason is hard work. Then, learning about logical fallacies, how to overcome our own bias, is hard. Reasonign involves following evidence to a logical conclusion. Melanie Trecek-King (Thinking is Power.com) describes it:</p>
<p>Evidence-&gt;Reasoning/Logic-&gt;Conclusion</p>
<p>AI makes it very easy to rationalize, or to select evidence to justify a conclusion. Rationalizing might be described as:
Desired Conclusion -&gt; Motivated Reasoning (confirmation bias) -&gt; Incomplete, low quality evidence</p>
<p>AI makes it a simple matter to construct motivated reasoning with any evidence to reach the desired conclusion. But the fear with students using AI is that students NEVER develop a way of gathering evidence, figuring out what it says, then coming to a conclusion. The reason why is that writing has been the way that’s been done for a long time.</p>
<h2 id="fear-3-ai-replaces-peoples-functions">FEAR #3: AI REPLACES PEOPLE’S FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>One of the tough things to comprehend is that AI can replace the work trained professionals do. It can do it effortlessly under the right tutelage and with the right prompts. This means that people’s work product, what they get paid to produce (as opposed to being paid to reason) is easy to replace. With one person and an AI, I may get away with cutting a few other jobs.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to imagine AI robots eventually taking over physical tasks that are dull, repetitive, and which employ low-skilled workers. Worse, we can easily imagine AI using its own power to leapfrog from advancement to advancement to replace jobs that involve creation of some work product.</p>
<p>Those are three of the fears I see in people who resist AI. Whether they are supported by evidence, that is another question. And, that aligns to the FLOATER analysis below.</p>
<h2 id="floater">FLOATER</h2>
<p>What I do now is try to remember and run my own reasoning through the AI application of Melanie Trecek-King’s FLOATER, an acronym for sorting through misinformation. You can <strong><a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2022/02/a-life-preserver-for-staying-afloat-in-a-sea-of-misinformation/">learn about it here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This is what a FLOATER-powered AI (Perplexity) had to say about the fears I raise above using a <strong><a href="https://mglinks.org/2024/03/27/megaprompt-critical-thinking.html">FLOATER megaprompt (a.k.a. long prompt) I prepared</a></strong>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>To evaluate the claims about the fears of AI in education using the FLOATER model, we will assign a score to each letter of the acronym based on the provided sources and the reasoning behind each score. The scores will range from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest (least satisfactory) and 5 being the highest (most satisfactory).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The fears outlined in the query about AI in education are <strong>logically presented</strong> but <strong>lack empirical evidence and objectivity</strong>. They do not fully consider alternative explanations or potential benefits of AI. To adhere to the FLOATER model, it would be necessary to support these fears with empirical data, consider alternative perspectives, and present conclusions tentatively, acknowledging the complexity and evolving nature of AI in education.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>In this article, Dr. Joe Phillips points out the end is nigh. He isn’t referring to climate apocalypse but rather the end of school funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for schools and districts, the implications could significantly mirror those of the Great Recession—widespread budget cuts, potential layoffs, increased class sizes, and a rollback of services that will likely disproportionately affect high-needs communities and students the most.

<p>I previously referenced the budget cliff in <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/04/23/this-has-to.html">another blog entry</a></strong>, sharing local RIFs and layoffs. The impact will be felt outside schools, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if staffing levels were to fall back to the same levels they were before the pandemic in 2018-19, districts would need to lay off 384,000 full-time staff, according to Chad Aldeman, an education analyst.

<h2 id="the-tsunami-of-school-unemployment">The Tsunami of School Unemployment</h2>
<p>A friend in public schools recently related how his superintendent was planning to cut a whole department (Instructional Technology). I shared my insights with him, pointing out it wasn’t about him but the tsunami wave of cuts headed towards public school education.</p>
<p>And, it’s not like it is all that great to be there for many educators:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s about to get worse.</p>
<h2 id="yesterday-when-i-was-young">Yesterday When I was Young</h2>
<p>(great song by that title!)</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday when my mentor gave me a similar appraisal as I saw my team cut in half in a large urban school district. It was unreal then.</p>
<p>I still remember HR encouraging me to fill one more position even after I told them that tech allotment funds were disappearing. I had multiple meetings where I had to explain to their incredulity what was coming. Now, I can’t help but laugh a little at my own naivete. Character-building experiences.</p>
<p>Shockingly, HR didn’t believe me right away 😒. That changed fast.</p>
<h2 id="history-repeats-itself">History Repeats Itself</h2>
<p>This chat with a colleague last week took me back in time when I lost half my team (3 professionals) due to the end the state technology allotment.</p>
<p>The cut back then was especially egregious given that I had successfully worked to get a team member recognized as Ed Tech Facilitator of the Year. She was let go as part of a reduction in force. Some others I highly respected also lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Other districts lost everything and everyone in edtech. The negative impacts endure today, over a decade later.</p>
<h2 id="doom-crier">Doom Crier</h2>
<p>With looming layoffs, I can only give one suggestion to those who may find themselves in for a world of chaos due to Texas malevolent politics, ESSER funding fumbles, etc.</p>
<p>No doubt, fascist legislators and governors are relishing (ala starve the beast that George Lakoff warned us about in his book  <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Think-Elephant-Debate-Progressives/dp/1931498717?dplnkId=40ee4532-70b3-41df-824b-08d84bc5cfe8&amp;nodl=1">Don’t Think of an Elephant</a></strong> ) this logical conclusion to their shenanigans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leave education. Get out while you can do it of your own volition and find a job in another industry. Do it NOW, while those jobs are still available.</p>

<p>The verdict is in…again?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it takes a lot more brainpower, as well as cross-talk between brain areas, to write than type.</p>

<p>Writing by hand…improves memory and recall of words, laying down the foundations of literacy and learning.
In adults, taking notes by hand during a lecture, instead of typing, can lead to better conceptual understanding of material.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gripping a pen nimbly enough to write is a complicated task, as it requires your brain to continuously monitor the pressure that each finger exerts on the pen.
Then, your motor system has to delicately modify that pressure to re-create each letter of the words in your head on the page.
The relative slowness of the medium forces you to process the information, writing key words or phrases and using drawing or arrows to work through ideas, she says. &ldquo;You make the information your own…”

<p>I heard or read about this topic in news earlier this week. I was hopeful because 4-day work weeks are great in my own experience.</p>
<p>But, yikes! This research on the topic was not what I was hoping for schools. That feeling aside, it’s good to see more research on this.</p>
<p>It should discourage schools from going with four day work weeks. Why?  The negative impact on student learning.</p>

<p>Here is Perplexity’s take via 3-2-1 format with citations at the end.</p>
<p>Here is the information in the 3-2-1 format with 3 facts, 2 quotes, and 1 scientific conclusion:</p>
<h3 id="3-facts">3 Facts:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As of the 2022-23 school year, around 900 school districts across 26 states have adopted a four-day school week schedule.[9]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four-day school week model is most prevalent in rural areas, where districts face challenges like smaller tax bases and difficulty attracting/retaining teachers.[7][14]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research indicates that while the four-day week can aid in teacher recruitment and retention, it may have a small negative impact on student achievement, particularly for minority, low-income, and special needs students.[2][9]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-quotes">2 Quotes:</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The four-day school week may offer that additional flexibility in areas where maybe they just can&rsquo;t offer teachers greater monetary compensation.&rdquo; - Paul Thompson, Economics Professor at Oregon State University [4]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has ever said once that going to four days is better for kids. No one has ever said it is better for learning. They&rsquo;ll say it hasn&rsquo;t hurt. But the research is so limited. …. We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; - Doug Beck, Missouri State Senator [6]</p>
<h3 id="1-scientific-consensus">1 Scientific Consensus</h3>
<p>While the four-day school week can provide some benefits like improved teacher recruitment/retention and cost savings for districts, the existing research suggests it may have adverse effects on student learning outcomes, especially for already disadvantaged student groups.</p>
<p>The impact varies based on implementation details like how instructional time is adjusted. More comprehensive, long-term studies are needed to fully understand the tradeoffs of this schedule change.[2][3][5][9][10][14]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should we use coconut-plant liners in metal baskets for hanging plants?&rdquo; I did a double-take. &ldquo;Why would you want to do that?&rdquo; I asked. But then, I realized I really knew nothing about coconut plant liners. Why would anyone use them? This question helped me realize how I could identify core competencies for AI, at least, from my limited perspective at this time. Come along as we explore the path taken.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-our-students">Preparing Our Students</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/05/08/prelude-to-ai.html"><strong>a previous blog entry</strong></a>, I shared key points from <a href="https://www.highereducationdigest.com/our-students-future-in-an-ai-world-is-debatable/"><strong><em>Our Students' Future in an AI-World is Debatable.</em></strong></a>  This article shifted my perspective a bit, breaking down in a little more detail how we need to prepare our students. That said, the article didn&rsquo;t go far enough in detailing those skills and strategies students need. I suspect that&rsquo;s because certain terms the authors relied on were inclusive of the skills and strategies.</p>
<p>The authors, Anand Rao and Stefan Bauschard, point out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developing…<strong>metacognitive</strong> abilities equips learners with the higher-order thinking skills necessary to effectively leverage AI tools, evaluate AI-generated information, and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly automated workforce. (<a href="https://www.highereducationdigest.com/our-students-future-in-an-ai-world-is-debatable/"><strong>source</strong></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig into this a bit more.</p>
<h2 id="getting-metacognitive">Getting Metacognitive</h2>
<p>For example, one of the most valuable skills, they said, was <strong>meta-cognition</strong>. What does it mean to be meta-cognitive, though? If you ask someone off the street, you might get, &ldquo;Thinking about thinking?&rdquo; posed right back at you. But since &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t well-defined for most people, I&rsquo;d bet folks don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Educators might define metacognition in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metacognition is the science of paying attention to how we learn so that we can learn better. (Source: <a href="https://blog.tcea.org/paying-attention-in-class/"><strong>Four Ways to Show Your Teacher You&rsquo;re Paying Attention in Class</strong></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; suggests a research-based process, a formal way of going about things. What&rsquo;s evident is that scientific research offers several actions can be taken (elaborated on in the blog entry cited). But for many, &ldquo;metacognitive awareness&rdquo; is not well-defined. A lack of a clear definition isn&rsquo;t the only obstacle for human beings.</p>
<p>The main obstacle human beings face? It&rsquo;s our own respective brains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Research-Based-Strategies-Ignite-Student-Learning/dp/1416628584/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Research-Based+Strategies+to+Ignite+Student+Learning&amp;qid=1629062665&amp;sr=8-3&amp;pldnSite=1"><strong>Authors Dr. Judy Willis and Malana Willis</strong></a> highlight the power of the brain&rsquo;s Reticular Activating System (RAS). The Reticular Activating System (RAS) works as an information filter. The RAS allows only one percent of the information to filter through. That’s right; your attention intake filters block millions of bits of information, keeping out the irrelevant. This is a challenge for teachers because it prevents students from paying attention to and retaining what is being taught.</p>
<p>How do you get around that?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="three-strategies-for-meta-cognition">Three Strategies for Meta-cognition</h2>
<p>From an educator&rsquo;s perspective, the following three strategies are helpful:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Boost curiosity</strong> to make learning memorable and desirable. Some approaches to achieve that include heightening engagement through story, humor, anecdotes, questions with long pause (5+ seconds) to wait for response, topic-related visual aids (e.g. cartoons, photographs, charts), entry/exit tickets (a.k.a. bell ringers).</li>
<li><strong>Encourage predictions</strong> enhance learning while it is happening (ask students to make predictions about how something works, what it does, and how it is relevant)</li>
<li><strong>Get metacognitive</strong>. Encourage students to reflect on learning so increase depth of knowledge, identify deficient or missing areas, contextualize knowledge, make structural connections in knowledge and social networks among learners</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose is to train our &ldquo;attention filter&rdquo; (the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/reticular-activating-system#:~:text=The%20reticular%20activating%20system%20(RAS,awake%2C%20desynchronized%20cortical%20EEG%20patterns.)"><strong>RAS in our brain</strong></a> to prioritize information over distraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to think of meta-cognition to heighten awareness, self-regulation, and, reflecting on how well we are thinking about something. You know, that self-regulation is so important. Let&rsquo;s come back to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When my colleague sets out to use coconut liners for hanging plants, the path she takes is different than mine. We might arrive at a similar conclusion but how we got there might be biased towards aesthetics (&ldquo;Oooh, they look nice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh, they drip water all over the place&rdquo;) or utility (&ldquo;Plant that require water and aeration live longer&rdquo;). The RAS in our brains is going to limit or free us based on past experiences that caught our attention. And, every person has prioritized information differently from childhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="self-regulation">Self-Regulation</h2>
<p>Self-regulation is included in meta-cognition because it is about students predicting progress towards meeting set goals. In other words, as a learner, I have an idea of where I might be at (phase of learning) and my teacher has identified success criteria that describe where I need to be (learning intention). How do I move from here to there?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>Note:</strong> Source of chart linked below</p>
<p>Depending on what phase of learning I&rsquo;m in (e.g. Pre-Structural, Uni/Multi-Structural, Relational, or Extended Abstract), better described in <a href="https://blog.tcea.org/data-informed-student-groups/"><strong>The SOLO Taxonomy chart</strong></a> above, I&rsquo;m going to need help (e.g. scaffolding) identifying where I&rsquo;m at, and how to get to desired level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Pre-Structural phase, I know nothing about the value of coconut liners or that they even exist. Over time, I start to see how they might be a viable alternative to existing hanging plant containers and other types of liners. At some point, I&rsquo;m able to get abstract about my understanding of coconut liners and apply that concept to a new situation. It might be a situation that allows the affected organism what they need to survive (e.g. food, water, air or peace, hope, and love).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="easy-peasy">Easy Peasy</h3>
<p>This seems really simple as I write it, right? I think of it as a video game, where you get wiped out by the obstacles in the game until you slowly learn to navigate them safely. You &ldquo;grow&rdquo; and improve until what stopped you before isn&rsquo;t an obstacle any longer.</p>
<p>We do this constantly in real life, and self-regulation is a big part of that. We are able to gauge and predict our progress as we work towards our goals in a constant, ever-changing adjustment to that work.</p>
<h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2>
<p>Another key aspect of all this is critical thinking. Critical thinking can be a tough area for human beings. It has an effect size of .84, according to the Visible Learning MetaX database.</p>
<p>The reason why it’s tough, albeit important to learn, is that there is so much to be an expert at. You have to know quite a bit about a field of knowledge.</p>
<p>You also have to understand how to apply critical thinking processes, and you have to do this while avoiding logical fallacies (<a href="https://blog.tcea.org/ai-megaprompts-for-coaching-and-critical-thinking/"><strong>source</strong></a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…critical thinking appears among necessary outcomes at educational institutions. Yet, “it is not supported and taught…in daily instructions.” Why? “Teachers are not educated in critical thinking” (Source: <a href="https://www.improvewithmetacognition.com/metacognition-and-the-fish-in-the-water/"><strong>Improve with Metacognition</strong></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="core-ai-competencies">Core AI Competencies</h3>
<p>For human beings, the core competencies are important to highlight. They don&rsquo;t change for us as human beings, but they get fine-tuned with new technologies, of which the latest is Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>To identify those, here&rsquo;s a single-point rubric that identifies them.</p>

<h2 id="coconut-plant-liners">Coconut Plant Liners</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to coconut plant liners. We need to know quite a bit about coconut plant liners for hanging plants before deciding we can use them, right? In a moment, we&rsquo;ll apply the single-point rubric to our thinking.</p>
<h3 id="why-coconut-plant-liners">Why Coconut Plant Liners?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons why coconut plant liners are useful. They provide the following for plants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent moisture retention</li>
<li>Good drainage of water (to prevent over-watering)</li>
<li>Possess aeration properties (allowing for air flow)</li>
<li>Natural coconut fibers are highly absorbent. They hold lots of water but release it slowly, and that helps the root system of a hanging plant (which might dry out too quickly since it&rsquo;s hanging, not buried)</li>
<li>Antifungal</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to benefits to the hanging plant, coconut plant liners are:</p>
<ul>
<li>renewable</li>
<li>biodegradable</li>
<li>environmentally friendly</li>
<li>aesthetically pleasing</li>
<li>come in various shapes and sizes</li>
</ul>
<p>How would we use our single-point rubric to assess our research into coconut plant liners for hanging plants? I&rsquo;m not sure if this works the way I intended. I could be totally wrong.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the revised response in a 3-column table format, divided by section, similar to the provided rubric. This particular response to my prompt (shown below) was crafted by Claude.ai Opus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prompt: Let&rsquo;s apply the single-point rubric to the question of whether you should use coconut plant liners for hanging plants on your Austin, Texas backyard porch, given the daily heat of 100 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I could have spent more time crafting this prompt. See the end of this blog entry for the RETO acronym to prompt engineering.</p>

<p>From my perspective, these were the best insights from a brilliant article. The article is <strong><a href="https://www.highereducationdigest.com/our-students-future-in-an-ai-world-is-debatable/">Our Students’ Future in an AI-World is Debatable</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The more I read these, the more I see a roadmap for becoming an AI Thinker, a topic I will have to explore in another blog entry. As I read I read the key points in my notes from the article again, it seems like a rationale for doing the same old thing that we have consistently failed to do across education institutions. Is that good or bad? On the positive side, it grounds our use of AI tools in the best we know about humans learn and think. On the bad side, it means that the tools we&rsquo;ve spent so much time learning to use have changed. Now, we have to ask ourselves, <em>How well do our developed learning, thinking, communication, and collaboration strategies and skills lend themselves to use of AI-powered thinking?</em></p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-humans-do">This is What Humans Do</h2>
<p>For me, this insight puts fear of AI in its place. That&rsquo;s because <strong>isn’t becoming a tool-using, critical thinking person always going to be what we do? And, the main thing that changes is the tool we use?</strong> If it’s not a stick to get ants out of a hole, it’s an AI chatbot to model a problem and engage in rapid prototyping of a variety of solutions.</p>
<p>No matter where you fall on that continuum of tools (e.g. stick to AI), critical thinking, communication, collaboration matter.</p>
<h2 id="reconfiguring-our-brains">Reconfiguring Our Brains</h2>
<p>It reminds me of one of my favorite books, <em>The Genesis Machine</em>. A radical new understanding of physics enables powerful new technologies. But the researchers/physicists of the new tool can&rsquo;t use it UNTIL they reconfigure how their brain works. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re facing with AI&hellip;reconfiguring our brains to take full advantage of AI.</p>
<p>So HOW exactly do you configure or reconfigure your brain to take full advantage of new tools? Or even more simply, how do you rewire your brain for new environments and tools to survive?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magic of becoming an AI Thinker. How exciting!</p>
<h2 id="my-notes">My Notes</h2>
<p>Here are the takeaways from Rao and Bauschard’s wonderful article, <strong><a href="https://www.highereducationdigest.com/our-students-future-in-an-ai-world-is-debatable/">Our Students’ Future in an AI-World is Debatable</a></strong>, that got me thinking in these pre-dawn hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we prepare our students for the AI-driven workplace of the future? The answer is not prioritizing teaching them AI tools that may become obsolete by the time they graduate but…
helping them develop the metacognitive skills they need to succeed in a world where AI, synthetic biology, and quantum computing will rapidly advance.
It’s…apparent that the traditional higher education model, concentrating on memory, repetition, and long-form written expression of what is known, is insufficient as we struggle with this new and constantly changing reality.</p>
<p>In today’s rapidly changing world, the most valuable skills will be</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the ability to think critically,</li>
<li>continually identify complex problems,</li>
<li>solve these problems,</li>
<li>question our assumptions, and</li>
<li>exercise our meta-cognitive faculties to adapt to new situations.</li>
<li>communicate effectively and collaborate one-on-one and in groups, both with each other and with interactive AI tools</li>
<li>meta-cognitive skills including metacognitive awareness, self-regulation, and the ability to think critically about one’s thought processes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Developing…metacognitive abilities equips learners with the higher-order thinking skills necessary to effectively leverage AI tools, evaluate AI-generated information, and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly automated workforce.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="my-reflection">My Reflection</h2>
<p>Essentially, the takeaway here is straightforward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>develop students using proven, evidence-based instructional strategies as well as how to be a part of the scientific community via debate within the context of AI-powered work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I read this, I am reminded of Jonathann Rauch’s _The Constitution of Knowledge _.</p>
<p>Jonathan shares in his book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A scientist is a trained professional who is plugged into thousands of others through journals and universities and scientific organizations. They have their own rules and customs, resources, and vocabulary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful right? How are we going to use AI according to our own rules and customs? Jonathan goes on to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As humans, we all outsource our interpretation of reality and even our perceptions of reality, to our social groups and personal networks. What will become scientific knowledge is produced collectively through the clashing and meshing of a variety of points of view.</p>
<p>As long as background beliefs can be articulated and subjected to criticism from the scientific community, they can be defended, modified, or <em>abandoned</em> in response to such criticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the context of AI, it&rsquo;s not enough to prepare our students and young folk to</p>
<ol>
<li>Think critically in meta-cognitive ways, identify and solve complex problems. It&rsquo;s ALSO super-important that we:</li>
<li>Communicate and collaborate with each other, as well as</li>
<li>Test our ideas, our perceptions and interpretations of reality, in a scientific community. That is, a community where our ideas can be tested by others , errors brought to light, and those ideas corrected or discarded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Very powerful concepts. I can&rsquo;t wait to explore this further in a subsequent.</p>

<p>I stumbled onto the John Decker Supernatural series of books one weekend. From werewolves to weird creatures to John the Ripper, the author Anthony M Strong has done a phenomenal job with the Decker books. If you&rsquo;re looking for great writing about monsters, then Strong&rsquo;s 15 book series about John Decker is not a bad place to begin. I&rsquo;m only about halfway through, but I was delighted to see how many books I&rsquo;ve missed and now get to catch up on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Working out the kinks today will make for a better tomorrow.&rdquo; - Fortune Cookie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A conversation earlier this week highlighted that there are times when a fast response isn&rsquo;t the best one. As one gets older, it&rsquo;s easy to look back and ask, &ldquo;How might I have handled that better?&rdquo; Of course, the only real value in doing that is to learn and do better for the future, rather than engage in disappointment in your past actions.</p>
<p>The trouble is that it is so easy to rush through a task, or a piece of writing. As someone who writes to a deadline, and has to produce a lot of content, I realize how much of a rush I&rsquo;m in all the time. The to do list never gets shorter, and the goal of that may be to keep one busy and unreflective on what&rsquo;s happening. But the reason for a long to-do list that keeps filling up, no matter how fast you complete a task, could be something else.</p>
<h2 id="no-shortcuts">No Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Add to this the bit of wisdom I stumbled upon later in life&hellip;&ldquo;There are no shortcuts.&rdquo; If you want to really learn something, put the time in. You have to embrace the suck aspect of every job to get the pearl.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like this fortune cookie quote at the end of my meal today. Take the time to work through the kinks, those problems and issues, and do it, not only to complete the job, but also to learn as much as you can from the experience&hellip;to, as Henry David Thoreau put it, &ldquo;suck the marrow out of&rdquo; every experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That is quite a helpful piece of advice. As a young person, I&rsquo;m not sure I was able to understand it. The reason why is the push to get from one thing to the next, to finish this job to get to the next. You never stop to study the door or the lock in front of you except to smash it or pick it to get through it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> When you play a video game, do you play to finish or to explore each level, even if it delays finishing the game? Your answer may well reflect your perspective on this topic. ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-better-understood-past-a-more-rewarding-tomorrow">A Better Understood Past, A More Rewarding Tomorrow</h2>
<p>What experiences could I have had that would have taught me this lesson sooner? The list is a list of everything I avoided so as to NOT learn that lesson. Working out the kinks might get me a better tomorrow, but learning everything I could about each kink&hellip;that would have ensured a better tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="more-time-now">More Time Now</h2>
<p>All that aside, I enjoyed the meal and the fortune cookie. And, going forward, I&rsquo;m going to spend a bit more time on the obstacles rather than just finishing them to get to the next level.</p>

<p>What an interesting idea…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iteration is the antidote to the performance mindset’s toxic grip. Instead of fixating on rigid goals, I have discovered the <strong>Iterative Mindset</strong>, a research-backed antidote to performative goals that encourages us to embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process. &gt; It’s about reframing setbacks as opportunities for growth rather than reasons to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>Our research on thousands of people has shown that adopting an Iterative Mindset is the key driver of sustained habit change.
By treating setbacks as valuable data for each iteration, we shift our focus from perfection to progress.

&ldquo;Yes, it could be that,&rdquo; the doctor said. The family member immediately looked at me. She knew I&rsquo;d used an AI to whittle down her various diagnoses from the symptoms shared. The doctor appeared impressed I had made a diagnosis. But it had been easy using Perplexity to ask questions. In the end, though, I&rsquo;m not a doctor. I only pretend to be one with an AI at my fingertips.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if solutions like <strong><a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/google-med-gemini-medical-ai-models-introduced-outperforms-gpt-4-5564367">Google&rsquo;s Med-Gemini</a></strong> will be the same. per that Gadgets 360 article, the claim is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google claims Med-Gemini will provide more factually accurate, reliable, and nuanced web search results compared to Gemini.

<p>Should we even be using AI given the negative impact on climate, the environment, on disadvantaged people? Or, as <a href="https://mastodon.education/@helgztech@fosstodon.org/112365457413132817"><strong>Helgztech put it so delicately</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you&rsquo;re comfortable with exploiting the labor of those whose work was scraped to create the AI output? The unacknowledged writers and artists? And the underpaid workers who trained the models? And the power consumption?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s recap that argument with a bit more detail. See citations at the end of this blog entry for links supporting each of Helgztech&rsquo;s points.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Eight newspapers are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for using their articles to train AI systems without permission.

</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-ai">The Problem with AI</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering about Helztech&rsquo;s assertions, let&rsquo;s review them again:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI use exploits the labor of people in third world countries who have to sort through tons of yucky content (e.g. porn) to filter out what is appropriate and what is not. These are data labellers, delivery couriers, and content moderators who engage in large volumes of monotonous, mentally draining labor.  <strong>Counter:</strong> <em>Advocate for fair wages, better working conditions, and proper recognition for workers.</em></li>
<li>AI steals from writers and artists, not giving them any credit for their work that it vacuumed up off the web and elsewhere to become a faceless, unattributable blog of information that it can draw upon when developing responses to the multitude of questions and prompts people ask it to respond to.  <strong>Counter:</strong> <em>In regards to data scraping and intellectual property, proper attribution, increased respect for IP rights, and compensation issues need to be worked out.</em></li>
<li>AI uses inordinate amounts of power for hours to weeks during taining, causing equipment to run at high capacity. This results in increased energy consumption.  AI equipment, due to its high capacity usage, results in the use of lots of energy, both for computation and for the liquid cooling systems (which involves a lot of water usage, often in places that can&rsquo;t afford to spare the water) <strong>Counter:</strong> <em>Ensure that AI system become more efficient and rely on clean energy sources going forward.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This can&rsquo;t be the first time in human history technology has resulted in ethical challenges and issues.</p>

<p>I am sure that the table shown above doesn&rsquo;t even come close to capturing the exploitation of labor, as well. As I write this, an example comes to mind. One that I grew up with as a boy in the Republic of Panama.</p>
<h2 id="the-panama-canal">The Panama Canal</h2>
<p>I grew up in the shadow of the Panama Canal, where an estimated total of 27,609 workers (many brought over from Caribbean countries) died during its construction. Those deaths came about as a result of yellow fever, malaria, and other tropical diseases.</p>
<p>However, the human toll doesn&rsquo;t include the environmental impact, water usage, economic and social inequality of the Panamanian people, and Panamanian sovereignty.</p>
<p>Even if you consider all that&rsquo;s wrong with the Panama Canal, its use continues today. The Panamanian government gets an average of $2.5 to $3.4 billion dollars from 2017-2021. Revenue generated by those who ship products through the Canal is in the billions.</p>
<p>Where there is money to be made, it&rsquo;s the practice of human beings to do whatever it takes to get it. Like the Panama Canal, I don&rsquo;t see human beings stopping all development and use of AI.</p>
<h2 id="al-in-schools">Al in Schools</h2>
<p>Some would argue that these points do not negate the benefits and positive use cases of AI once the concerns are addressed. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with AI usage by the public since the money makers and everyone else already recognize the value of AI development and use.</p>
<p>You may be asking, &ldquo;What about AI in schools?&rdquo; Should we be using AI in schools given the valid points Helgztech makes? It&rsquo;s really an ethical question, right? But it doesn&rsquo;t matter at this point. We keep repeating a pattern of technology being pushed into schools, regardless of the ethical considerations.</p>
<p>In each case, there were edtech advocates who encouraged the use of technology in K-12 classrooms, modeling their use, staging learning events around it. If those people had, en masse, decided to do something else, what would have been the result? Would the technology still have found its way into schools?</p>
<p>In considering the examples that appear further down below, I asked Claude.ai those questions. I don&rsquo;t disagree with the response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the edtech advocates (K-12 educators) had collectively decided not to promote or model the use of these technologies with ethical concerns, it&rsquo;s likely that the adoption of these technologies in schools would have been significantly slower or more limited. Educators play a crucial role in shaping the use of technology in classrooms, and their endorsement or resistance can greatly influence the widespread adoption of any given technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the absence of educator support, several scenarios could have unfolded:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Limited adoption: Without the advocacy and modeling by educators, many schools may have been less inclined to invest in or implement these technologies. This could have resulted in a more piecemeal or sporadic adoption, with only a few schools or districts choosing to use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delayed implementation: The lack of educator buy-in could have delayed the widespread implementation of these technologies, giving more time for ethical concerns to be addressed or for alternative solutions to be developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased scrutiny: If educators had collectively raised concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies, it could have led to increased public scrutiny and pressure on the companies developing them. This could have prompted more proactive efforts to address the ethical issues before widespread adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative solutions: In some cases, the absence of educator support for a particular technology could have created a void that encouraged the development and adoption of alternative, more ethically-sound solutions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to note that while educator support is a significant factor, it&rsquo;s not the only one that influences the adoption of technology in schools. Other factors, such as market forces, political pressures, and the influence of technology companies, also play a role. In some cases, these factors may have still driven the adoption of certain technologies, even without the full support of educators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, not all educators may have been aware of or concerned about the ethical implications of these technologies, and some may have advocated for their use despite these concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, while the collective decision of edtech advocates to not promote or model the use of ethically concerning technologies would have likely slowed or limited their adoption in schools, it may not have completely prevented their eventual implementation. Nonetheless, educators have a significant influence and responsibility in shaping the use of technology in K-12 classrooms, and their stance on ethical issues can make a substantial difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I could have said it better myself.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve shared in the past, one of the reasons I started <em>Another Think Coming</em> was how often I found myself revisiting old ideas that were no longer accurate or reflective of new information.</p>
<p>You wake up one morning and the preponderance of the evidence has forced you to reconsider what you long held dear. You realize that you are plain wrong, so you&rsquo;ve got <strong>another think coming</strong> about everything you once held dear or thought true.</p>
<p>To that end, I focus a lot in this blog on sharing quick ideas and going deeper into critical thinking, AI, etc. In this entry, I explore some of the things I read in Jonathan Rousch&rsquo;s <em>The Constitution of Knowledge</em>, a book I heartily recommend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An Aside:</strong> The other part of <em>Another Think Coming</em> blog is that I had grown bored with my writing at the intersection of education, technology, and leadership at <em>Around the Corner</em>. While you can still access the old content (and search it) at <a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com">mguhlin.blogspot.com</a>, I decided to step away from those ideas. I&rsquo;d started that blog to wrestle with Web 2.0 ideas, social media, and all that. Now, I&rsquo;m in a different place.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dealing-with-uncertainty">Dealing with Uncertainty</h2>
<p>I loved this quote from Michel de Montaigne because it captures the general equivalence all human beings are set up with that makes it so hard to argue that my certainty is better than your&rsquo;s, when chances are, it&rsquo;s as flawed. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably what frames the problem with &ldquo;both sides&rdquo; arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The uncertainty of our senses makes everything they produce uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read that again. We can&rsquo;t simply rely on our senses.</p>
<h2 id="certainty-versus-evidence">Certainty versus Evidence</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://daily-ink.davidtruss.com/certainty-versus-evidence/">In his blog entry</a></strong>, David Truss affirms the epistemological crisis we are all facing. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are living through an epidemic of certainly at the expense of evidence. Selectively chosen facts are sprinkled on emboldened ideas that sit like concrete, embedded deep in the minds of people who are certain they are right.</p>
<p>Contrary evidence is tossed aside. If it doesn’t fit my truth or my world view then, it’s wrong, it’s misinterpreted, it’s fake news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the real struggles people have is knowing how to resolve this issue. How do you know who or what to believe? How certain can you be of any perspective, including your own? David&rsquo;s reflection reminds me of a <strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thinking-clearly/id1260807921?i=1000622213610">Thinking Clearly podcast featuring Jonathan Rauch</a></strong></p>
<p>He is the author of several books, but the most relevant is <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Constitution-Knowledge-Jonathan-Rauch/dp/0815738862">The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-are-we-so-certain">Why Do Are We So Certain?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The certainty epidemic is growing and it’s getting harder and harder to sift through the BS, and actually know what evidence to follow,&rdquo; says David Truss. This isn&rsquo;t a new problem, though. Throughout history, we have seen people struggle with their own cognitive biases, the power of the tribe, and more.</p>
<p>In his book, Rauch makes the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a belief becomes important to the way we think about ourselves or important to the group we identify with, changing it becomes very costly (The Identity-Protective Cognition by Dan Kahan)</li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands of year of practice at believing whatever will keep us in good standing with our tribe, even if that requires denying, rationalizing, misperceiving, and ignoring the evidence in front of our nose&hellip;if a belief performs the function of defining a group and knitting it together, it plays the social role of a sacred or religious belief.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --> When facts challenge the belief the congregation will defend its faith by denying the facts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>How do you overcome human programming that make us willing to deny the facts when they go in the face of how we think about ourselves or the group we belong to?</p>
<p>My hope was, as David Truss expresses, that we would be able to live up to &ldquo;&hellip;the idea that we continue to learn and reformulate our theories and make them better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we know that&rsquo;s not always going to happen. What we know, our ability to evaluate evidence is more than simple intellectual exercise.</p>
<p>As Rauch points out in his book, citing Cailin O&rsquo;Connor and James Owen Weatherall, we must recognize that cognition is a group process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our ability to successfully evaluate evidence and form true beliefs has as much to do with our social conditions as our individual psychology.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, more is needed.</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-bacon">Revisiting Bacon</h2>
<p>In <em>The Constitution of Knowledge</em>, Rauch does a spectacular job of summarizing history of how a constitution of knowledge was created.</p>
<p>One of the citations is Sir Francis Bacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge comes not from what truth seekers believe, but what they do: Make observations and perform experiments which eliminate wrong answers and point us toward right ones.</p>
<p>Using this method, we can overcome the inherent flaws of our senses and cognition (Idols of the Tribe), the limits of our individual experiences and parochial viewpoints (Idols of the Cave), and the errors of received dogmas and superstitions (Idols of the Theatre).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is powerful stuff.  To summarize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge doesn&rsquo;t come from what people think, but from what they do. They watch, try things out, and learn which answers don&rsquo;t work and which ones do. This way, we can get past our natural mistakes and limits, and the wrong ideas we&rsquo;ve been taught.</p>

<p>In his blog entry, David describes the issue of confirmation bias&hellip;that we look for facts that support our perspective, discarding the ones that don&rsquo;t fit. Instead, we need to find ways to prove our hypothesis of how things work, wrong. What is the error in our thinking?</p>
<p>We need to be willing to be people who are willing, as Charles Sanders Peirce says (as cited in Rauch’s  book), &ldquo;&hellip;at all times to dump [their] whole cartload of beliefs the moment experience is against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given how much we invest into our beliefs as children, it is hard to do.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-and-truth-are-public">Knowledge and Truth Are Public</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Knowledge can be made only when it can be validated by others. Unless truth be recognized as public, as that of which any person would come to be convinced if he carried his inquiry,&rdquo; is a tough excerpt from a quote by Rauch.</p>
<p>Without community, you can believe whatever you want. It&rsquo;s not until you drag your truth into the commons that others can test it to see if it is true.</p>
<p>That is the process Bacon appears to have identified&hellip;making observations and then testing and experimenting.</p>
<p>Those who do will never be 100% certain of the truth, but the increasing evidence and scientific consensus (based on individual experiments by others) can shift you from a hypothesis to a widely accepted theory.</p>
<h2 id="another-think-coming">Another Think Coming</h2>
<p>As David points out in a <strong><a href="https://daily-ink.davidtruss.com/changing-our-opinions/">follow-up blog entry</a></strong>, dumping your beliefs in light of new evidence requires courage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It always surprises me the that changing of one’s opinion is seen as weak. To me it’s a sign of strength.</p>
<p>Openly admitting that you’ve changed your mind based on new evidence is a superpower.

<p>We all have another think coming, don&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p>What relief I have as a parent that my children made it through college, one of them persevering through the COVID pandemic to graduate. Relief that makes you weep, especially when I read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most students at colleges that close give up on their educations altogether. Fewer than half transfer to other institutions, <strong><a href="https://sheeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SHEEO_NSCRC_CollegeClosures_Report1.pdf">a SHEEO study found</a></strong>. Of those, fewer than half stay long enough to get degrees.</p>
<p>Many lose credits when they move from one school to another and have to spend longer in college, often taking out more loans to pay for it <strong><a href="https://hechingerreport.org/colleges-are-now-closing-at-a-pace-of-one-a-week-what-happens-to-the-students/">(source.)</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many are affected by this situation of closing colleges? Better sit down for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rest join the growing number of Americans — now more than 40 million, according to <strong><a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/some-college-no-credential/">the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center</a></strong> — who spent time and money to go to college but never finished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know trade schools and other venues offer options but being college educated, the second in my family after my mother who went to teacher college in Panama, it still means something. I would rather college plus technical certifications than simply the latter.</p>

<p>In education, I&rsquo;ve noticed how important is for people to always be upbeat and positive. It&rsquo;s a bit of a strain having to endure people doing their best to avoid losing it. If something bad happens, it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge it.</p>
<h2 id="big-reasons-for-layoffs-what-do-the-numbers-say">&ldquo;Big&rdquo; Reasons for Layoffs. What do the numbers say?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-jobs-cuts-layoffs-march-2024/">U.S. companies announced</a></strong> over 90,000 job cuts in March 2024, marking a 7% increase from February.</li>
<li>The technology industry <strong><a href="https://qz.com/google-amazon-apple-tech-layoffs-1851173569">continues to see substantial layoffs</a></strong>, with over 46,000 layoffs reported in the first two months of 2024 alone</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/tech-layoffs-2023-list/">High-profile</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/tech-layoffs">companies like</a></strong> Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have made significant cuts</li>
<li>K-12 education is facing layoffs due to expiration of federal pandemic relief funds, declining enrollments, budget challenges, seniority-based layoffs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-it">Dealing with It</h2>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re watching people drop around you, you wonder, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we pause for a moment as a group of human beings to acknowledge what&rsquo;s happening here? That person lost their job. That person decided to leave because of a toxic workplace. My goodness, why can&rsquo;t we speak to each other about this except in hushed whispers in the parking lot?&rdquo; You know what I mean. We&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>
<p>I can remember the first time it happened. And the second. And the third. The morbid fascination of watching someone lose their job, get escorted to the door. Some times, it&rsquo;s that gal who said she was suffering from workplace injuries but then danced her way to the door of her car in the parking lot when she thought no one was looking.</p>
<p>Except, too bad, so sad, the video feed to the parking was on and the top honcho saw it. That guy wasn&rsquo;t happy. The injured, not really, person lost her job pretty quickly. You don&rsquo;t feel much sympathy for her. She was lying.</p>
<p>But there are others who lose their jobs, and you know it&rsquo;s politics or whatever. Incompetent leadership. Alleged insubordination. A refusal to let things go because the boss is wrong. Or, all those &ldquo;big&rdquo; reasons for layoffs. And, the feeling of that person&rsquo;s separation is awful. You&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>You survived.</p>
<h2 id="layoff-survivor-guilt">Layoff Survivor Guilt</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling I&rsquo;ve had a few times over my career:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Layoff survivor guilt is a natural response to the emotional turmoil of witnessing colleagues lose their jobs while one remains employed. Surviving employees may experience a range of emotions in response, including relief, guilt, anxiety, and uncertainty about their own future within the organization <strong>(<a href="https://careerminds.com/blog/survivor-guilt-how-outplacement-can-boost-your-engagement-and-retention-rate">source</a></strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s hilarious is the suggestion in the article above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations should prioritize <strong>open communication, emotional support, and professional development</strong> opportunities for surviving employees to help them cope with layoff survivor guilt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if. As if open communication was REALLY an option. As if PD, or even acknowledging the REAL problem was possible. I&rsquo;ve been in workplaces like that, too. You know, where they say, &ldquo;Hey everybody, if you need to talk about Jerry separating from here, come talk to me, the person who fired him. I can show you the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<h2 id="district-level-craziness">District Level Craziness</h2>
<p>Anyone who works in schools has seen how principals get separated from their campuses. They get moved from one campus to the next. Then, they get a posh HR spot. Or put in charge of some area that they know nothing about. I had an assistant superintendent who ended up as assistant superintendent of technology SIMPLY BECAUSE they didn&rsquo;t want him being in charge of schools. Why didn&rsquo;t anyone ever demote me into a six figure paying job? Sheesh. ;-)</p>
<p>The goal, the newly minted CTO told me, was to humiliate him into leaving. He knew nothing about the job. Nothing. So, he grabbed a spoon and scooped up that humiliation and ate it right up. Terrible. School admins do it all the time.</p>
<p>Another situation is when a new superintendent walks in the door. For whatever the reason, the people in the job aren&rsquo;t to his/her liking. So, the super decides to clean house, even though, these people are well-established and doing a wonderful job in their position. As they walk out the door at the end of the year (if they make it that long), they smile and wave and act like they aren&rsquo;t getting screwed over by a megalomaniac supe who&rsquo;s only going to be hitting the road him/herself in a few years because they couldn&rsquo;t deliver on their crazy agenda.</p>
<p>I watch those people leave, and I can&rsquo;t help but shake my head in disgust. You hope for divine justice, karma, or anything, but the truth is, there isn&rsquo;t anything. It&rsquo;s the way things are. You can continue doing your job, gather evidence that ends up being a hit job on the new boss (and it doesn&rsquo;t work because the people who hired the new boss have too much ego and &ldquo;face&rdquo; invested in ensuring that person&rsquo;s success), or just walk away yourself.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-deal-with-survivor-guilt">How To Deal with Survivor Guilt</h2>
<p>After awhile, you learn to deal with the guilt of still having a job. You remind yourself that you&rsquo;re still getting a paycheck. You throw yourself into your work, experiment with new ideas, get in touch with why you still love your work, even if the building is crumbling around you (building is a euphemism for culture in this self-talk). You make lists of all the things you enjoy doing, and how all that might go away if you decide to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>You wait for some mystical power (uh, no) to exercise retribution on the person(s) causing all the survivor guilt. When I think about &ldquo;Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,&rdquo; quote I realize how perfectly religion has been developed to keep us all conforming.</p>
<p>You can find tons of places that offer advice on how to survive the layoff of a coworker or more than one. I focus on being creative, on making stuff. I remind myself that as long as I keep creating, I&rsquo;m employable. I also sharpen my resume, my portfolio site, make a list of new skills I want to learn.</p>
<p>Then, I mourn. I make a list of the people that are gone. I ask myself, &ldquo;What did I do to ease their passing?&rdquo; That might be a kind note, a letter of recommendation, a farewell lunch.</p>
<p>And, then&hellip;I let them go. I keep moving with my WHY firmly in mind. You realize that really, you set yourself up. You set yourself up with false expectations of what success is. You remember that&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="11-actions-to-take">11 Actions To Take</h2>
<p>You decide to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Offer guidance to those who act without considering the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and uplift those who are disheartened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assist those in need and show patience to everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that harm is not returned with harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strive for the well-being of each other and all people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find joy in every moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remain open-minded and grateful in all situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your enthusiasm and curiosity alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be open to new ideas and experiences, but critically evaluate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace what is beneficial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid harmful actions and influences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And, somehow, everything is OK.</p>

<h2 id="the-fading-attraction-of-edtech">The Fading Attraction of EdTech</h2>
<p>I had a laugh (then a cry) about this image:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Image above via Larry Cuban on Technology in Schools as cited by Dr. Gary Ackerman (@garyackerman@qoto.org)</em></p>
<p>Today, I am still enthusiastic about technology in schools. It is the enthusiasm of someone who uses technology every day to create and make. For me, technology inspires me, enables me to create in ways I couldn&rsquo;t do without it. That is the promise of technology. But, our continued pursuit of edtech hyped solutions in K-12 to radically improve student achievement was never sustainable. Now, I am seeing the same pattern with AI.</p>
<p>Let us make an end of edtech hype, relegate technology to an everyday tool that amplifies our creativity and connects us to one another in fundamental human ways, like knowing how to read and write do.</p>
<h2 id="doubting-thomas">Doubting Thomas</h2>
<p>Now, I find myself in the position of a doubting Thomas, a disbeliever, who sees how edtech advocates (including myself) believed in several big lies about teaching and learning with technology. Those may have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology heightens engagement, and engagement leads to increased student learning and academic achievement</li>
<li>Constructivist approaches work, and technology is best paired with these approaches over traditional methods</li>
<li>Phonics doesn&rsquo;t work, pleasure reading works better</li>
<li>Projects, Problems, and Inquiry-based learning can do the heavy lifting of engaging minds and getting them to process ideas in ways that leads to long-term information retention</li>
</ul>
<p>It is sobering to realize how much truth, and inaccuracies, exist in those ideas. But if they aren&rsquo;t the whole truth, then what is? And, should I worry so much about it now that I know better? After all, isn&rsquo;t the whole idea to prove something wrong to find what is true?</p>
<h2 id="stop-drinking-the-kool-aid">Stop Drinking the Kool-Aid</h2>
<p>For many who drank the Kool-Aid, the secret sends them down the path of folly. It is time to wake up. And, some have.</p>
<p>A lot of people have caught on, perhaps due to the perceived remote learning fiasco (you know, when thousands of teachers had to teach remotely without the benefit of years of blended learning experience, and students simply didn&rsquo;t learn as well resulting in low scores on <strong><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/pearson-education-115026">extremely expensive, high-stakes assessments</a></strong> on national and international tests. These expensive exams were paid for with taxpayer funding to little purpose).</p>
<p>This is evident as you look at these graphs in Joanna Glasner&rsquo;s (@jglasner) article, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/edtech/education-tech-startups-funding-falling-2023-byjus/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=SocialSnap"><strong>Edtech is No Longer a Funding Fave</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="unesco-report-claims">UNESCO Report Claims</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at each of these claims in turn. To do that, I&rsquo;m going to group them into &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; of interest:</p>
<h3 id="evidence-based-teaching-and-learning">Evidence-Based Teaching and Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good, impartial evidence on the impact of education technology is in short supply.</strong></li>
<li>There is <strong>little robust evidence</strong> on digital technology&rsquo;s added <strong>value in education</strong>.</li>
<li>A survey of teachers and administrators in 17 US states showed that <strong>only 11% requested peer-reviewed evidence</strong> prior to adoption.</li>
<li>A review of 23 mathematics applications used at the primary level showed that they focused on <strong>drill and practice</strong> rather than advanced skills.</li>
<li>In Peru, when over 1 million laptops were distributed without being incorporated into pedagogy, <strong>learning did not improve</strong>.</li>
<li>In the United States, <strong>analysis of over 2 million students found that learning gaps widened</strong> when instruction was exclusively remote.</li>
<li><strong>Mere proximity to a mobile device was found to distract students</strong> and to have a <strong>negative impact</strong> on learning in <strong>14 countries</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="professional-development-for-educators">Professional Development for Educators</h2>
<ul>
<li>Teachers often feel <strong>unprepared</strong> and <strong>lack confidence teaching</strong> with technology.</li>
<li>Only half of countries have standards for developing teacher ICT skills.</li>
<li>Few teacher training programs cover cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Around two-thirds of education software licenses were unused in the United States. (if teachers don&rsquo;t know how to use edtech, it will sit unused).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="environmental-impact">Environmental Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>One estimate of the CO2 emissions that could be saved by extending the lifespan of all laptops in the European Union by a year found it would be equivalent to taking almost 1 million cars off the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider this information, and you get some sobering takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>EdTech has a negative effect on teaching and learning</li>
<li>Teachers lack professional development to use edtech they have, much less emerging technology</li>
<li>Saving the planet may involve NOT equipping every child in school with short-term laptops (like Chromebooks) and double use time</li>
</ul>
<p>If you add AI&rsquo;s environmental impact to the list above, it can be quite sobering.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ais-take-on-my-notes-above">AI&rsquo;s Take on My Notes Above</h2>
<p>I asked Perplexity Pro to evaluate the claims made above, providing additional citations. Below, you will find the results:</p>
<h3 id="evidence-based-teaching-and-learning-1">Evidence-Based Teaching and Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>The report underscores the scarcity of good, impartial evidence on the impact of education technology, noting that technology evolves faster than it can be evaluated, with education technology products changing every 36 months[1].</li>
<li>It mentions the lack of robust evidence on digital technology&rsquo;s added value in education and highlights a survey where only 11% of teachers and administrators in 17 US states requested peer-reviewed evidence before adoption[1].</li>
<li>A review of 23 mathematics applications used at the primary level showed a focus on drill and practice rather than on developing advanced skills[1].</li>
<li>The distribution of over 1 million laptops in Peru without integration into pedagogy did not improve learning, illustrating the importance of incorporating technology into teaching strategies[1].</li>
<li>In the United States, an analysis involving over 2 million students found that learning gaps widened with exclusive remote instruction, emphasizing the challenges of online learning[1].</li>
<li>The report also points out that mere proximity to a mobile device can distract students and negatively impact learning, a finding observed across 14 countries[1].</li>

<ul>
<li>Teachers often feel unprepared and lack confidence in teaching with technology, highlighting a significant gap in professional development[1].</li>
<li>Only half of the countries have established standards for developing teacher ICT skills, indicating a lack of uniformity in teacher training on technology use[1].</li>
<li>The report notes that few teacher training programs cover cybersecurity, underscoring a critical area of need in the digital age[1].</li>
<li>It also mentions that around two-thirds of education software licenses were unused in the United States, suggesting that without adequate training, educational technology often remains underutilized[1].</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environmental-impact-1">Environmental Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The report includes an estimate of the CO2 emissions savings that could be achieved by extending the lifespan of all laptops in the European Union by a year, equating it to removing almost 1 million cars from the road[1]. This points to the significant environmental impact of technology in education.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings from the UNESCO 2023 Global Education Monitoring Report present a nuanced view of the role of technology in education. While technology holds immense potential for enhancing learning, its implementation and impact are contingent upon careful consideration of evidence-based teaching practices, adequate professional development for educators, and awareness of environmental implications[1].</p>

<p>Ok, you’ve heard that <strong><a href="https://www.meta.ai/">Meta.ai</a></strong> is now available for free. The question is, “What features are in place to secure your data? Can you trust Meta/Facebook/Threads/Instagram/Whatsapp/Messenger?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook, now Meta, has faced numerous privacy issues while maintaining its supremacy as the top social media network in the world. This includes the infamous Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal of the 2010s, FTC privacy charges, data harvesting or scraping incidents and more. (<strong><a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/what-are-the-potential-privacy-and-security-issues-with-metas-new-threads-an-instagram-app-2/">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can imagine free AIs sucking up your data, using it to train their AI, but failing to safeguard your content that becomes theirs as soon as you enter it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook AI use reported by Wired:
“Meta’s online ad library shows the company is hosting thousands of ads for AI-generated, NSFW companion or “girlfriend” apps on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. They promote chatbots offering sexually explicit images and text, using NSFW chat samples and AI images of partially clothed, unbelievably shaped, simulated women.” <strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ads-for-explicit-ai-girlfriends-swarming-facebook-and-instagram/">source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, it IS Facebook we are talking about. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity offer safeguards and give you the option of opting out your data to train their AI. But what about Meta.ai?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nope. Not an option.</p>
<p>Be careful to put nothing sensitive or confidential into AI chatbots.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="response-from-metaai">Response from Meta.ai</h3>
<p>The scientific consensus on the effectiveness of Prevagen is as follows ¹ ² ³ ⁴:</p>
<p>Lack of Strong Research: There isn&rsquo;t strong research that apoaequorin taken by mouth boosts memory.</p>
<p>One Small Study: The Prevagen website points to one small study that was sponsored by the supplement’s maker.</p>
<p>Flawed Study: Some neuroscientists had a different take on the results. They said the study didn&rsquo;t show that people who took Prevagen benefited significantly more than the placebo group.</p>
<p>No Clear Proof: Experts usually don&rsquo;t consider the findings of one small study as clear proof of anything.
FDA Stance: The U.S. FDA has not evaluated Prevagen for safety and effectiveness and has tried to curb claims that it may help memory.</p>
<p>AARP Recommendation: A group of scientists, doctors, scholars, and policy experts brought together by the AARP said it couldn&rsquo;t recommend any ingredient or supplement marketed for brain health after reviewing the available research.</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association Caution: The Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association cautions that claims about memory-enhancing dietary supplements are mostly based on very little science.</p>

<p>I love the <strong><a href="https://flip.it/U4ze7a">title of this article by Jessica Grose:</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every Tech Tool in the Classroom Should Be Ruthlessly Evaluated</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes me think of a gardener ruthlessly pruning roses in a garden, pulling out weeds, making space for growing things. Ok, that&rsquo;s the extent of my gardening knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="pruning-digital-tools-and-failed-instructional-strategies-from-classrooms">Pruning Digital Tools and Failed Instructional Strategies from Classrooms</h2>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s ineffective technology or failed instructional strategies, it&rsquo;s time to stop doing what doesn&rsquo;t work. Don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>
<p>As we see a wave of AI tools finding their way into classrooms, schools and districts, you have to wonder, <em>Where&rsquo;s the evidence?</em> Again and again, we keep coming back to digital tools to somehow accomplish something they weren&rsquo;t designed for from the get-go: Ensuring deep learning happens, and that students are able to apply that learning to new situations.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we">How Can We&hellip;?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KassandraR24/status/1782461443834601622">Kassandra Rios asks this question in a post</a></strong> on the Elon Musk owned network:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can educators teach students to use AI in the classroom? #EdTech #teaching #learning #EdTechInTheClassroom #AI #education</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, my response included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several different types of instructional strategies aligned to surface, deep, or transfer learning. For students in surface to deep learning, I don&rsquo;t recommend AI since you want to build student critical thinking. I see definite applications during transfer learning, where students are applying what they have learned to new, novel situations for rapid prototyping (e.g. quickly trying out new solutions or getting AI to anticipate results).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I mention an article I wrote on <strong><a href="https://blog.tcea.org/data-informed-student-groups/">Flexible Grouping</a></strong>. But the more I think about it, the less convinced I am at AI&rsquo;s utility to directly impact student learning. Most of the edtech tools I see are really productivity tools, information management focused. AI tools definitely fall into this category. I can see their use in the classroom by teachers, but for students, that means short-circuiting or denying them the learning and critical thinking they need to be engaged in.</p>
<p>A key quote from Jessica Grose&rsquo;s article is this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And while there are certainly benefits to using tech as a classroom tool, I’m convinced that when it comes to the proliferation of tech in K-12 education, we need “a hard reset,” as Julia Freeland Fisher of the Christensen Institute put it….</p>
<p>We need a complete rethink of the ways that we’re evaluating and using tech in classrooms; the overall change that I want to see is that tech use in schools — devices and apps — should be driven by educators, not tech companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if we COULD do a hard reset, STOP PAYMENT on all the recurring payment technology tools in schools. There&rsquo;s certainly
competing priorities for that funding. After all, how much would a district-wide LMS cost a 50K student school district? At least one full-time professional educator, no? And, what about the investment in computer labs and portable labs used for high-stakes assessments? From my own experience, the cost is considerable&hellip;from a few hundred thousand to millions every few years, depending on the size of the school district.</p>
<p>But the goal isn&rsquo;t to get rid of technology everywhere. It IS to re-evaluate, &ldquo;ruthlessly,&rdquo; as Grose puts it, the technology that we allow in the classroom that directly impacts instructional efforts. Those tech tools, or digital tools, should be put on a list, and then evaluated for evidence. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the scientific consensus on the use of XYZ popular tool in the classroom? Anecdotal evidence isn&rsquo;t allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose that the truth is, a better response to Kassandra&rsquo;s question is, &ldquo;What evidence is there that shows the efficacy of AI for use by students?&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-artificial-intelligence-playbook">The Artificial Intelligence Playbook</h2>
<p>In a new book, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Playbook-Time-Saving-Teachers/dp/1071949632">The Artificial Intelligence Playbook</a></strong>, the authors say the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this spirit, we invite you to consider AI as a virtual teaching assistant that can provide support to you. We hope that the tools in this playbook provide teachers with more opportunities to directly interact with their students, which not only is the reward of teaching but also is irreplaceable by a computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the description, the focus is on AI as a <strong>virtual teaching assistant</strong>. I can definitely see the value of this for educators. In their virtual book jacket (a book I just started reading, BTW), the authors (or is it the publishers?) tout the book as highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose Writing Prompts and Avoid Plagiarism</li>
<li>Manage Content</li>
<li>Foster Student Engagement</li>
<li>Meet Students’ Instructional Needs</li>
<li>Assess Student Learning</li>
<li>Continue Lifelong Learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I can&rsquo;t argue with those uses of AI. All of that is certainly made easier by AI (except the &ldquo;Avoid plagiarism&rdquo;&hellip;AI detectors are notoriously bad&hellip;see the scientific consensus with citations on them at the end of this post). The question isn&rsquo;t whether teachers can use AI to make their jobs easier and less onerous.</p>
<p>Rather, the question is, &ldquo;What evidence is there that supports using AI to impact student learning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, so far, the evidence is lacking. Unless you consider that, so far, AI is being hyped as the cure to education ills. Yet, we already know what works in schools. More technology isn&rsquo;t it. Instead, it&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://blog.tcea.org/meet-aldo-amazing-lesson-design-outline/">high-effect sized instructional strategies that work.</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="scientific-consensus-on-ai-writing-detectors">Scientific Consensus on AI Writing Detectors</h2>
<p>The following is taken from Perplexity Pro&rsquo;s response to my prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the scientific consensus on the use of AI detectors to stop students from having AI chatbots compose their writing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you read the response below, ask yourself, &ldquo;Is my school or district investing in these ineffective technologies?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="response">Response</h3>
<p>The scientific consensus on the use of AI detectors to stop students from having AI chatbots compose their writing suggests that <strong>these detectors are not entirely reliable</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the research, AI text classifiers, such as GPTZero and OpenAI&rsquo;s own AI text classifier, have been found to misclassify a significant portion of human submissions as AI-generated and vice versa.</p>
<p>For instance, OpenAI&rsquo;s Text Classifier <strong>misclassifies 5% of student submissions as AI-generated</strong>, and <strong>49% of ChatGPT’s submissions as human-generated</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GPTZero has a higher false positive rate of 18%,</strong> but a lower false-negative rate of 32%[5].</p>
<p>Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to obfuscation attacks. A simple attack involving running the ChatGPT-generated text through a paraphrasing tool like Quillbot significantly increased the false-negative rates for both classifiers. After such an attack, the false-negative rate for OpenAI&rsquo;s text classifier jumped from 49% to 98%, and for GPTZero, from 32% to 95%[5].</p>
<p>These findings indicate that while AI detectors can be a part of the strategy to identify AI-generated text, they cannot be solely relied upon due to their limitations in accurately detecting AI-written content and their vulnerability to simple manipulation techniques. The consensus suggests that a more nuanced approach, possibly combining AI detectors with critical human evaluation and changes in assessment strategies, might be necessary to effectively address the issue of AI-generated submissions in academic settings[2][3][5].</p>

			 <p>That tempter of old has crept again into the garden offering forbidden knowledge, knowledge unearned and undeserved, once again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tony Wan writes a wonderful article on the subject of AI, covering key points we must all remember as we rush to bite the apple from the tree of knowledge, forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>It doesn’t offer any real answers to the question of AI in schools short circuiting and potentially atrophying student’s critical thinking. That aside, it is worth reading, especially this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When groundbreaking technologies enter schools, old skills and habits make way for new ones. Some we may not miss much, like cursive handwriting. 
Other conveniences come at a cost: Typing on keyboards has largely replaced writing by hand, even though research shows the latter is better for memory and learning (and for carpal dexterity). 
Reading in print improves comprehension more than digital text, even though our eyes are fixated on screens these days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So what do we gain and lose when students use artificial intelligence to write?</p>

<p>Alas, I have made my way back to cursive writing, reading in print, an old man doddering among the ruins of yesteryear, and it is bliss to slow my mind down. Perhaps, that is the result of AI, an accelerated movement to a stunning conclusion that forces us back to basics, an ejection from the digital paradise.</p>

<p>Is AI dumb? If you read Seth Godin, <strong>&quot;<a href="https://seths.blog/2024/04/chatgpt-is-dumber-than-it-looks/">ChatGPT is dumber than it looks</a>,” maybe it is.</strong> Of course, he explains why that is so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason AI language models are dumb is that they don’t actually know anything, the model is simply calculating probabilities. Not about the unknown, but about everything. Each word, each sentence, is a statistical guess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to point out that he uses Claude.ai with specific instructions as to how to best do so. He&rsquo;s not alone in doing so.</p>
<h2 id="ai-can-boost-productivity-20-40">AI Can Boost Productivity 20-40%</h2>
<p>The authors of <strong><a href="https://www.theneurondaily.com/p/ai-not-good-yet">The Neuron newsletter</a></strong> write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the hyperbolic forecasts we often hear from tech CEOs about AI during earnings calls, here’s a reality check: AI in 2024 isn’t all that impressive.
Yeah, we said it, don’t @ us.
That’s not to say it’s worthless—if leveraged properly, today&rsquo;s AI can boost productivity by 20-40% in areas like coding, writing, and HR.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="really-dumb">Really? Dumb?</h2>
<p>You know when your organization or team says, &ldquo;Oh, they don&rsquo;t know anything or they&rsquo;re not really all that good,&rdquo; about a competitor? It makes me wonder, &ldquo;Am I suffering from superiority bias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suspect the real reason we&rsquo;re saying AI is so dumb is that we&rsquo;re afraid of what that really means for us. If AI is smart, intelligent, or at least, good at mixing words together in ways that make sense to our monkey brains (you know, break it down Barney style), then it&rsquo;s smart enough to not be called dumb.</p>
<p>Having relied on AI for data analysis, I&rsquo;m inclined to think it&rsquo;s pretty smart. Whether I&rsquo;m using Perplexity or Claude, I can see that it&rsquo;s able to do things that would take me hours to do myself. What&rsquo;s even more incredible, ensuring the right prompt with sufficient context, interactive dialogue and explanation can be quite helpful to the AI. It&rsquo;s the kind of clarifying conversation you would have with a human being.</p>
<p>What am I arguing for here? Nothing really. Only that we should stop calling AI dumb. Instead, let&rsquo;s be realistic about its capabilities without ascribing godlike intelligence to language learning models running on huge server farms.</p>

<p>When your students say, learning hurts their brain, believe them…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New research reveals that the process of remembering something long-term comes at a cost – specifically, inflammation in the brain and DNA damage in nerve cells, as the memories get &lsquo;fused&rsquo; into neurons and stored.</p>
<p>But our findings suggest that inflammation in certain neurons in the brain&rsquo;s hippocampal region is essential for making long-lasting memories.&quot;</p>

<p>Cool, huh? More study needed but it’s fascinating.</p>

<p>In the screenshot of above of my son and I, in transit to a mission, he&rsquo;s the one determining which mission to go on, while I stand looking on off the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a cup of Liber-TEA,&rdquo; yells a Helldiver as he flings a grenade into the oncoming horde of mechanicals. Yes, I have joined that group of people playing Hell Divers 2, a game that smacks of Starship Troopers (the movie). See the game play in this video:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>The game is engaging and becomes better after you buy better armor and weapons, although not required. Last night, I had the opportunity to play with my son and found it a strange experience. Before I share about my Hell Divers gameplaying experience with my son, allow me to reflect on a gaming experience long ago when he was but a boy, 20 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="teachable-lessons-from-game-social-dynamics">Teachable Lessons from Game Social Dynamics</h2>
<p>In <em>Enemy Territory</em>, which I found myself playing in my thirties, my five year old son joined me in this team oriented game. We were both on the side of the Allies, fighting against the German soldiers. In an act only my son can explain, he started shadowing another player on our team who played the role of engineer. As an engineer, the player could plant mines. Unfortunately, with a little effort, my son&rsquo;s character was exploding the mines without suffering damage due to friendly fire. This meant that the extensive minefield laid down by a teammate was for naught.</p>
<p>The admin booted my five year old son from the game. I had been on another part of the map, and had not seen why. Neither had my son told me he had been booted, but I noticed his absence and that he had moved from the converted bedroom into an office into the playroom. He was, uncharacteristically, silent. When I found out what happened from him, using it as a teachable moment for him to admit he had been wrong to blow up a team member&rsquo;s mines, I corresponded with the game admin and explained the situation.</p>
<p>A father himself, he understood and allowed my son back in the game.</p>
<h2 id="hell-divers-2">Hell Divers 2</h2>
<p>In a strange role reversal, I found myself huffing and puffing (my character, not I) behind my son, trying to keep up as he effortlessly wiped out the robots coming to attack us and block us from achieving our objectives. I called down cluster bombs and orbital fire, only to accidentally wipe out my team mates and myself. The other players complained through group audio chat of my actions, and my son made light of the matter, taking action to allow me to respawn (to reinforce in gamespeak) in the game.</p>
<p>As it happened several times, it was quite simple for me to see the stunning change in roles. Where once I had been the expert, the intermediator to explain away the mistakes of my son, now he did the same for me.</p>
<p>It was a touching moment and I will treasure it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I don’t understand why some folks engage in censorship, especially here in America. When I read reports like <strong><a href="https://booksunbanned.com/documents/Books%20Unbanned%20Teen%20Testimonials.pdf">Books Unbanned</a></strong> I reflect on my own experiences with reading.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="werewolves-and-cave-bears">Werewolves and Cave Bears</h2>
<p>My first experience with books centered around exciting conventional reads, like Max Brand and Louis L’Amour westerns. I also read e.e. “Doc” smith as sci-fi and many others. I learned of America&rsquo;s history (albeit it, fake) from Dana Fuller Ross' <em>Wagon West</em> series, which enabled me to get the big picture of American history and do well in school. Historical fiction that improved my grades&hellip;who would have thought?</p>
<p>These books became heirlooms that ended up, in their entirety, in my daughter&rsquo;s care, all lovingly read and explored. She&rsquo;s now a Ph.D at a university in another state, having suffered no ill effects from wide reading. I have since graduated to digital books, not wanting to deal with the paper of print books, a decision that I regret not at all with fiction.</p>
<p>With nonfiction, I prefer print books to pore through and take notes from. With fiction, I seldom re-read, since touching a book or viewing its cover immediately recalls the story to my mind. Quite frustrating for an avid reader&hellip;for a long time, the best story I ever read was the forgettable one, since that meant I could read it again and again.</p>
<p>While my interests were mostly Western and Sci-fi, I occasionally stumbled upon books that made me open my eyes a bit then look around to see who might be reading over my shoulder.</p>
<p>These stories included the first time I had seen someone write about sex in the context of werewolves. The story was terrifying In itself, but that the seductress was also a werewolf has stayed with me. It was my first exposure to sex in a book, and all the more memorable, assuming mythic proportions unequalled since. Obviously, I still don’t read books with a lot of sex in them. Maybe I should have.</p>
<p>Jane M Auel’s <em>Clan of the Cave Bear</em> introduced me to horrible things that happen to women…and made me sensitive to how men treat women. From neanderthals in Cave Bear to humans in love in <em>The Valley of the Horses</em>, I came to a better understanding of sex and the potential conflicts between people, no matter their species.</p>
<p>These books shifted my thinking, along with Dana Fuller Ross’ <em>Wagons West</em> series. I learned a tremendous amount from them, even if it was inaccurate.</p>
<h2 id="a-lesson">A Lesson</h2>
<p>Given the freedom to read, I didn’t seek out sex and pornographic writing. That has always been a valuable lesson. Sure, like any young man, I was curious about human relations. But I knew reading wasn&rsquo;t to be reduced to prurient accounts by characters limited to words on a page. Still, the encounters, the secret whispers and fumbling, tucked away in voluminous print volumes taught me something.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-exploration-freedom">Embracing Exploration, Freedom</h2>
<p>Having grown up in Panama and America, I came to value the espoused values of freedom from censorship and exploration (or at least the freedom).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Young people are trying to understand their place in this world. Of course they&rsquo;re exploring. And I want my children to live in a world where exploration is celebrated rather than admonished. The mental health toll of forcing everyone to assimilate to binaries is brutal.&quot;</em>
<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/struggling-moral-panic-once-again-danah-boyd-1ozsc">Source: Danah Boyd, Struggling with a Moral Panic Once Again</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is one I put into practice when I trusted my own children to be free range readers, to choose what they read and decided to pursue then measure that against the values my wife and I instilled in them.</p>
<h2 id="books-unbanned">Books Unbanned</h2>
<p>As I read this report, I see a generation of youth who are restricted in their reading by fear-mongering and fearful cults, who don’t believe in the values they espouse. I love these songs from my childhood, and though I wish I could set them aside, I remember how I felt when I sang them, so I cling to them.</p>
<p>John Michael Talbot&rsquo;s <em><strong><a href="https://www.streetdirectory.com/lyricadvisor/song/ulplua/be_not_afraid/">Be Not Afraid</a></strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall cross the barren desert/
But you shall not die of thirst/
You shall wander far in safety/
Though you do not know the way/
You shall speak your words in foreign lands/
And all will understand/
You shall see the face of God and live/
Be not afraid/
I go before you always/
Come follow me/
And I will give you rest/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dan Schutte&rsquo;s <em><strong><a href="https://catholichymn.blogspot.com/2015/01/though-the-mountains-may-fall.html">Though the Mountains May Fall</a></strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Though the mountains may fall and the hills turn to dust/
Yet the love of the Lord will stand/
As a shelter for all who will call on his name/
Sing the praise and the glory of God</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember and believed these promise of these songs, the story that there was nothing I could not face without a loving being by my side.</p>
<h2 id="a-dark-faith-grounded-in-preternatural-fear">A Dark Faith Grounded in Preternatural Fear</h2>
<p>But the faith that censors children’s reading habits, that quakes in fear of an unloving god that sups on the fear of believers, that causes them to rise up in hate to persecute and terrorize, that is not my faith.</p>
<p>As I read the report at <strong><a href="https://booksunbanned.com/documents/Books%20Unbanned%20Teen%20Testimonials.pdf">Books Unbanned</a></strong>, of children struggling to find stories where they are represented, I can’t imagine if my parents had said, “No, you can’t read that because it’s evil.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This library card is important to me because it gives me access to high-quality educational and cultural resources that I would not be able to afford otherwise. As an online high school student, I do not have a physical library nearby that I can visit, so having an eCard makes me feel connected.” —Age 17, Texas</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[My state’s] ‘divisive concepts’ law [has] forced many public school history teachers to censor their teaching for fear of being reported by parents…” —Age 23, New Hampshire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, I would have found a way. As these children have to unearth and confront the hypocrisy and lies of their parents and communities, seeking only the truth of their experience in the world….</p>
<h2 id="the-backlash-is-coming">The Backlash is Coming</h2>
<p>The backlash is coming, when these censored children realize the truths concealed from them. Oh, how awful will the regret be for the angry book burners and ban makers be. And for the others? They will simply be irrelevant, along with their fear and threats.</p>

			 <p>Interested in moving large files from one device to another? I know I was after setting up an obsolete Win10 machine with Linux Mint to give it new life. One of the things I want to do is quickly move files from one device to another. While I had experimented with Syncthing, I had failed utterly with FTP server setup and client. Honestly, it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve dabbled in this, I was tempted to use sneakernet (via USB flash drive) to load the files. But, I persevered.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it’s transmitted over the internet. <strong>Source:</strong> <strong><a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than persist with <strong><a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a></strong>, which has worked quite well for PC to PC transfers, I decided to give ResilioSync a try. It has an iOS app, which is one of the devices I want to try moving files to and from.</p>
<h2 id="resilio-synchttpswwwresiliocomindividuals"><a href="https://www.resilio.com/individuals/">Resilio Sync</a></h2>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s a proprietary solution, I said, &ldquo;Why not give it a shot?&rdquo; (cue horror stories, right?). Of course, it looks like to get advanced features, one would have to pay for it. I am only using the free features for a one-time transfer, then I&rsquo;m going to re-evaluate whether I want to use this much more.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-syncthing">Back to Syncthing</h2>
<p>Ok, so that was a really short test. Syncthing just worked, even offering QR codes to connect my devices. In no time, I had data moving from one machine to the other. The only hitch was purchasing a $4.99 iOS app, <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/m%C3%B6bius-sync/id1539203216">Moebius Sync</a></strong>. Aside from that, all my files were transferred in a jiffy!</p>
<p>Highly recommend!</p>

<p>Evolution is an old debate, and every year, I learn something new about it. I still remember studying this in my Catholic High School, explaining it at nineteen years of age to my girlfriend (later my wife). I can&rsquo;t imagine how we would have continued if she had believed in the literal interpretation of Genesis a la story of creationism or so-called &ldquo;intelligent design.&rdquo; That would have been a show-stopper. Fortunately, I had already read heretical works like Dick Westley&rsquo;s <em>Redemptive Intimacy</em> (which you can find in the Internet Archive). Before we get into evolution, let&rsquo;s clarify some terms.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>via the <strong><a href="https://thinkingispower.com/science-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-why-it-matters/">incomparable Melanie Trecek-King, Thinking Is Power</a></strong> (see explanation below)</p>
<h2 id="clarifying-terms-and-science">Clarifying Terms and Science</h2>
<p>One of the best explanations about science comes from Melanie Trecek-King. In her article, <strong><a href="https://thinkingispower.com/science-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-why-it-matters/">Science: What it is, how it works, and why it matters</a></strong>,&quot; she explains the following vocabulary that goes with the diagram she offers (see image above):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These terms are often a source of great confusion for non-scientists, as they can have drastically different meanings in everyday usage.
A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a testable explanation for a fairly narrow set of phenomena. They’re based on current scientific knowledge and observation, not wild guesses.</p>
<p>A <strong>scientific theory</strong> is a broad explanation for a wide range of phenomena. When evidence accumulates for multiple related hypotheses, they’re combined into a single, clear, and powerful explanation. Well-supported theories have been rigorously tested and have high predictive power. Examples include the theories of evolution, cells, germs, gravity, and relativity.</p>
<p>A <strong>scientific consensus</strong> is the collective position of evidence and/or experts (which is based on evidence). Recall that science is a social process: evidence is collected and evaluated as a community. A scientific claim is never accepted as “true” until it has gone through a lengthy process of careful scrutiny by fellow experts. Establishing a consensus can take significant time and evidence, but it’s the most trustworthy knowledge available at any given moment. The more diverse the community, the stronger the consensus, as they’re more likely to find each other’s biases and blind spots.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="improper-use">Improper Use?</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m sensitized to the difference in hypothesis and theory, I hear their improper use every day. That&rsquo;s why it makes perfect sense for people to have negative attitudes about &ldquo;The Theory of Evolution.&rdquo; For them, the word theory is defined as a guess that isn&rsquo;t based on current scientific knowledge and lacks evidence. However, the opposite is true&hellip;evolution is a scientific theory with evidence that tends towards a high level of certainty with near absolute proof (see diagram above).</p>
<p>You might <strong><a href="https://thinkingispower.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Types-of-Scientific-Knowledge-1-1536x864.jpg">find this breakdown</a></strong> of these and other scientific terms helpful.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-scientific-consensus">What is the Scientific Consensus?</h2>
<p>These days, I use Perplexity Pro to find answers to questions, like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the <strong>scientific consensus</strong> on <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/search/?q=prevagen">Prevagen memory enhancement</a></strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been quite helpful. I also rely on <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/11/mynotes-listening-and.html">Bartz&rsquo;s CRITIC</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/search/?q=floater">Trecek-King&rsquo;s FLOATER</a></strong>, two acronyms that can be applied to any news story or scientific study that &ldquo;changes everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I digress. Let&rsquo;s get back on the topic of evolution and changing attitudes.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-thoughts-on-evolution">My Own Thoughts on Evolution</h2>
<p>I still remember doing my &ldquo;own research&rdquo; for a voluminous high school research paper. I remember scoffing at creationism, intelligent design at the time after reviewing all the evidence for the theory of evolution. However, I did not have as clear an understanding. I imagined that evolution and God might both exist in the same space.</p>
<p>No doubt this was a result of my reading of those scientists who did the science and said something along the lines of, &ldquo;Science is about evidence, and has no opinion about God and faith.&rdquo; Who can blame these agnostics and closet atheists given the scary violent antics of fundamentalist Christians on topics like abortion, evolution, etc.?</p>

<p><strong>Image Source: <a href="https://ncse.ngo/">National Center for Science Education</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="attitudes-towards-evolution-evolve">Attitudes Towards Evolution, Evolve</h2>
<p>I found the following report via the <strong><a href="https://ncse.ngo/">National Center for Science Education</a></strong> to be quite interesting reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the hundredth anniversary of the Scopes &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; trial of 1925 approaches, a new study argues that the attitudes of American Gen Xers toward evolution changed toward acceptance and away from uncertainty as they aged, using a longitudinal dataset based on periodic surveys of 5000-odd participants born in the heart of Gen X over a 33-year period, from middle school to middle age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Research on attitudes toward science typically uses a single survey or a series of surveys of different participants,&rdquo; explained lead researcher Jon D. Miller of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Using the three-decade record from the Longitudinal Study of American Life enabled our study to investigate how attitudes develop and shift over formative decades in the same individuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Acceptance of evolution went from a plurality position between 38% and 44% to a majority position between 54% and 57%,&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> commented co-author Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education. &ldquo;At the same time, <strong>as participants matured, their uncertainty about evolution reduced</strong>, from 37% when they were in high school to between 11% and 13% when they were adults.&rdquo; (Source: <strong><a href="https://ncse.ngo/awesome-or-bogus-development-gen-xs-attitudes-toward-evolution">Awesome or bogus? The development of Gen X&rsquo;s attitudes towards evolution, <em>NCSE Monitor</em></a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s good news, isn&rsquo;t it? That a change in attitude is possible. This change, along with the <strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-read/2024/01/24/has-the-rise-of-religious-nones-come-to-an-end-in-the-us/">increase of the &ldquo;nones</a>,&quot;</strong> must be aggravating for fundamentalist believers. We are all dragged kicking and screaming into an awareness of the truth, our tightly held fantastical beliefs burning up in the sunshine of evidence and scientific consensus.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-about-god-but-humans-false-stories">It&rsquo;s Not About God, But Humans' False Stories</h2>
<p>Our stories of creation, evolution, all fall short of the reality of what happened. The former tries to explain through supernatural means how we came to be without any knowledge or evidence except made-up tales from long ago. The latter tries to analyze existing evidence, gathering everyone&rsquo;s best research and scientific consensus. Of the two, the scientific consensus is the more reliable.</p>
<p>However, both still fall short of the awesome reality of what actually happened. We weren&rsquo;t there, we didn&rsquo;t see it, all we have are the remains of yesterdays long gone. I have no problem, as a believer, tossing out holy books and stories of people who didn&rsquo;t have a clue about what happened. I do have one about tossing out evidence and scientific consensus.</p>
<p>Neither changes that we must remain loving, kind, and caring for each other. Hmm&hellip;.</p>

<p>In an upcoming blog entry on evolution attitudes changing, I cite some info from the National Center for Science Education. I ran into the group on Facebook, so I was curious as to whether it was a reputable organization. You might enjoy their <strong><a href="https://ncse.ngo/misconception-of-month">Misconception of the Month</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prompt to AI:</strong> Is the National Center for Science Education a reputable organization?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pretty straightforward question.</p>
<h2 id="ask-perplexity-pro">Ask Perplexity Pro</h2>
<p>So, I asked <strong><a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">Perplexity Pro</a></strong> to see what it might come up with. This is what it came up with. Information between the lines is AI response:</p>
<hr>
<p>Yes, the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) is considered a reputable organization. According to Media Bias Fact Check, the NCSE is rated as a pro-science source with high factual reporting and high credibility[1]. The organization is recognized for its advocacy for science education and support for the consensus of science. It is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1981 and is affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The NCSE&rsquo;s mission is to educate the press and the public on the scientific and educational aspects of controversies surrounding the teaching of evolution and climate change, and to provide information and resources to support these topics in public school science education[1][2].</p>
<p>The NCSE is funded through donations from individuals and science foundations and does not use emotional words, respecting the consensus of experts in the given scientific field[1]. It is also described as the United States' &ldquo;leading anti-creationist organization,&rdquo; promoting science in classrooms and providing resources to teachers[2]. The organization has a history of opposing the teaching of religious views in science classes in America&rsquo;s public schools and is involved in various activities and programs to support science education[2].</p>
<p>Furthermore, the NCSE conducts high-quality research to better understand science education and has been involved in significant legal cases such as Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, which tested the constitutionality of intelligent design in public school science classes[2][3]. The organization also publishes peer-reviewed articles, book reviews, and news related to science education[2].</p>
<p>In summary, the NCSE&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to promoting and defending science education, its affiliation with respected scientific organizations, and its active role in research and advocacy all contribute to its reputation as a credible and reputable organization in the field of science education[1][2][3].</p>

<p>Have a Windows 10 device in your life? Then it may be time to look for that exit strategy. Running a Surface Book laptop, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t want to mess with Windows 10 craziness. So, I decided to trade it in for GNU/Linux machine. Of course, I decided that before finding out that the onboard webcam won&rsquo;t work under Linux. Sigh. That necessitates an inexpensive USB webcam purchase (and software purchase of <strong><a href="https://www.linuxlinks.com/webcamoid-full-featured-webcam-application/">Webcamoid</a>)</strong>. Aside from that &ldquo;little&rdquo; detail, everything works smooth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is getting ready to annoy its faithful Windows 10 user base with yet another prompt. This time, Microsoft wants Windows 10 users to switch from using a local account to their online Microsoft account. via <strong><a href="https://mashable.com/article/windows-10-microsoft-account-shut-off-notifications">Mashable</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad. At work, I have a Windows 10 machine with awesome specs (it&rsquo;s a behemoth of a laptop, I don&rsquo;t know who thought it would be a good piece of equipment to lug around (I inherited it from my predecessor), which is what prompted me to invest in a Surface laptop back then). While I like Windows 11, it won&rsquo;t run on that <strong><a href="https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/withdrawnbook/ThinkPad_W540.pdf">Lenovo w540</a></strong> (as I recall). So, Linux Mint Cinnamon has been running great on the Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>The real issue is, &ldquo;What am I going to carry around when facilitating workshops?&rdquo; The truth is, a Google Chromebook will fill the need quite well. Too bad my Lenovo Chromebook Duet died last week, leaving me without a small form factor device. Bummer.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d carry the Surface running Linux Mint, but I need to do some more testing before I trust myself and it in front of a large audience during a presentation. The testing will start next week. Wish me luck. If not, I may end up asking for someone to buy me a&hellip;.</p>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci failed, if he hoped to keep men and women in ships safe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… I do not publish nor divulge [methods of building submarines] by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them.</p>
<p>&ndash; Leonardo da Vinci</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering my friend&rsquo;s requests about image timestamp modification recently, I was thinking about the ethics of technology how-to on the world around it. When formulating a sense of ethics, one might ask, &ldquo;How does this harm human beings? What is the impact of a technology, a scientific process, on people and those things that keep them afloat?</p>
<p>I found this quote from Arthur Galston in Kaj Sotala&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hxaq9MCaSrwWPmooZ/a-brief-history-of-ethically-concerned-scientists">A brief history of ethically concerned scientists</a></em></strong> quite interesting. Galston was the inventor of Agent Orange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to think that one could avoid involvement in the antisocial consequences of science simply by not working on any project that might be turned to evil or destructive ends. I have learned that things are not all that simple, and that almost any scientific finding can be perverted or twisted under appropriate societal pressures. In my view, the only recourse for a scientist concerned about the social consequences of his work is to remain involved with it to the end.</p>
<p>His responsibility to society does not cease with publication of a definitive scientific paper. Rather, if his discovery is translated into some impact on the world outside the laboratory, he will, in most instances, want to follow through to see that it is used for constructive rather than anti-human purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, anyone who has relied on technology, dealt in information (like a journalist) faces this dilemma. Should one provide information that may be used against others? That may harm others? Where&rsquo;s the line in the sand?</p>
<h2 id="what-about-ai">What About AI</h2>
<p>While government collusion with aliens, zombies, and other bad things have been ruled out due to ridiculousness, a lot of folks are worried about AI and its impact. An article from The Digital Learning Institute offers, as do many others, a sanguine opinion of AI&rsquo;s use in education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply put, educators need to have an open mind as to what they can do with this tool, and how it can assist both teachers and students to reduce their workloads. Seeing it as an opportunity can open several doors for learning opportunities – and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naysayers and doomcriers are either hiding amidst the outpouring of support for AI to be used in every human endeavor, or embracing their role as modern day Cassandras, ignored no matter how accurate their predictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Value-laden technology</strong> refers to technological artifacts that have inherent values due to their design, functions, and goals. In some cases, scientists and engineers focus on the technical aspects of creating such technology without considering the moral implications, which can lead to ethical dilemmas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The genie is, as usual, out of the bottle. There&rsquo;s no stopping this, right? Even if you could pull a Da Vinci on AI, there&rsquo;s too much money in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[It is] not a recommended general approach, as it may limit the progress of society by withholding valuable knowledge. Instead, <em>ethical scientists should evaluate each situation individually and ensure safety and responsible use</em> of technology while encouraging its beneficial applications.
In the context of AI and machine learning, such as with ChatGPT, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of its use in education.</p>
<p>While it can offer numerous benefits, such as personalized learning, virtual tutoring, language learning, exam preparation, and writing assistance, there are also potential shortcomings, such as providing wrong answers, biased translations, repetitive copy, lack of depth, and long-winded sentences.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential for educators and students to use AI tools like ChatGPT responsibly, understanding their limitations and ensuring the correct data is given. AI should act as a supporting role in developing students' creativity, critical thinking, and authentic content creation. <strong><a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">Source: Conversation with Perplexity Pro</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="focus-on-technical-not-ethical">Focus on Technical, Not Ethical</h2>
<p>In my own efforts, I have focused on the &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; use AI without giving much thought to the &ldquo;ethics.&rdquo; The how-to is a focus on the technical side of using AI to make mundane tasks easier to navigate. But is that really all there is for K-12 education?</p>
<p>Worse, how can such conversations even be had in a politically charged environment that is K-12 schools today? Just the other night during my walk, I was listening to the podcast, <strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/those-who-cant-teach-anymore/id1646723683">Those who can&rsquo;t teach&hellip;anymore</a></strong>. This fascinating podcast focuses on how politically charged school environments have become, leading to the exit of long-time, award winning educators.</p>
<p>In the podcast, one of the teachers (Atkinson) shares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;There were immense changes in education, in our society, and politics in the way that people thought about each other and treated each other, and it started to come into my classroom. . .I used to be able to have a conversation with kids about a current issue. And 100% explore both sides of that issue&hellip;How can you really teach kids to think of the world in which they live if you can&rsquo;t broach these subject?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, take AI in schools. I bet most of those who are bringing AI into schools and every other human endeavor are spending little to no time considering its impact. Except for fight or flight, it&rsquo;s just not a safe topic. No teacher is going to say to an administrator, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to learn MagicSchool.ai or XYZ tool&rdquo; because to do so sends a message about them.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-a-stick-in-the-mud">Are You a Stick in the Mud?</h2>
<p>In reflecting on my own adoption of AI, which I love, I have kept an eye on the impact AI has on people, climate, and others. But at a certain point, you realize, this is coming. The best I can do is ride this bomb down to the ground and see what I can do, as Galston says, to follow through for human purposes. That is, to be constructive and minimize the amount of harm done to human beings.</p>
<p>But it makes me wonder. Don&rsquo;t we end up just following our technology from one disaster to the next, cleaning up (if that) the previous disaster with the new one coming? How many times have you read&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute to the fight against climate change. Existing AI systems include tools that predict weather, track icebergs and identify pollution. AI can also be used to improve agriculture and reduce its environmental impact, the World Economic Forum says. <strong><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/02/ai-combat-climate-change/">The World Economic Forum</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. A lot. It makes me think of <strong><a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/clashroyale/">Supercell&rsquo;s Clash Royale&rsquo;s</a></strong> bomb-riding goblin (<strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/110f7cw/have_you_noticed_that_goblin_on_the_rocket_is_not/">image source</a></strong>:</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;How do you change the time a screenshot was created?&rdquo; asked a friend yesterday. What a curious question, I thought.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I asked? So, she explained the situation that required a file that she generated after a deadline to have a certain date and time. Apparently, the people who would receive the image would check.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Putting aside whether I should help her skirt the rules, I wondered, &ldquo;How does one do that?&rdquo; Although there were a wealth of tutorials available online, the one I settled on involved a freeware program.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---getting-the-right-software">Step 1 - Getting the Right Software</h2>
<p>You can find a lot of websites that say they will let you alter the &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; or &ldquo;EXIF&rdquo; data. To be honest, I found myself a bit confused at all the claims. And, what was needed was to change the date. This <strong><a href="https://www.organizepictures.com/2018/08/edit-exif-date-taken">tutorial at Organize Pictures</a></strong> was spot on. The author explains it in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before learning how to change photo date and time, you need to know what a digital photo date and time is. This piece of photo metadata is called a photo’s timestamp. Every camera records when a digital photo has been taken. This information is being recorded in the EXIF photo metadata and it is saved with a JPEG photo in a field called Date Picture Taken.  Now, different software may call this field slightly differently, but they all refer to a digital photo’s timestamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The freeware software to get the job done is <strong><a href="https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/#downloads">XnView</a></strong>, and it&rsquo;s available in Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux flavors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XnView MP is provided as FREEWARE (NO Adware, NO Spyware) for private or educational use (including non-profit organizations). If you enjoy using XnView, <strong><a href="https://secure.shareit.com/shareit/checkout.html?PRODUCT%5B300587021%5D=2&amp;js=-1">Don&rsquo;t hesitate to help the developer with a small donation</a></strong>. (Note: XnView is the source for the image appearing immediately below showcasing its interface).</p>

<h2 id="step-2---changing-the-date-and-time-in-a-photoimage">Step 2 - Changing the Date and Time in a Photo/Image</h2>
<p>These steps below have been modified from the Organize Pictures tutorial to reflect my journey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click once on the image thumbnail</li>
<li>Right click on the image thumbnail</li>
<li>Go to Metadata option, which will expand to offer several options, including &ldquo;Change timestamp&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<li>Adjust the date and time (as shown in the image below) then</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Write&rdquo;</li>

			 <p>What about dental care? David Truss writes this sermon about doing hard stuff. But is dental care even mentioned once?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Flossing is hard. Most dentists recommend it. Lots of people don’t do it.</p>
<h2 id="harder-things-bring-results">Harder Things Bring Results</h2>
<p>David Truss makes this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harder things bring results that you can see, and feel… and done often enough, the hard journey itself gets easier, even if the individual tasks remain hard. That’s the end goal, to make the hard things that are good for you easier to do, than the easy things that aren’t good for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>via <strong><a href="https://daily-ink.davidtruss.com/easier-and-hard/">Daily Ink</a></strong></p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t argue with him about it too much. The more I work out, the more pounds I lose. But for a lazy person, the desire to find that point of &ldquo;just enough effort&rdquo; to get the desired result is highly motivating. And, some things aren&rsquo;t worth your time&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientific consensus on flossing and long-term dental care suggests that while evidence on flossing&rsquo;s effectiveness in reducing plaque and gingivitis is mixed and sometimes of low quality, it remains a recommended practice as part of a comprehensive oral hygiene routine. Flossing, along with toothbrushing and professional dental care, contributes to the prevention of periodontal disease, tooth decay, and tooth loss, potentially enhancing oral health and longevity. Despite debates and varying levels of evidence, maintaining good oral hygiene through practices including flossing is considered beneficial for long-term dental health and retention. <strong><a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">via Perplexity.ai on the question of flossing</a></strong></p>

<p>The things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> managers value in their employees?</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical skill</li>
<li>Lack of complaints about stupid ideas managers foist on staff in their bid to be relevant, innovative, responsive to the market</li>
<li>Obedience</li>
<li>Initiative aligned to organization goals, but not too much</li>
<li>Patience while company takes forever to adopt what is obvious</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are my takeaways from watching managers work. But I like this bit of wisdom from Doug “Blue Skunk” Johnson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…[it is not] the best worker (engineer, teacher, mechanic, nurse, etc.) that gets ahead, but the person who is able to manage and lead good workers and so create an effective workplace.</p>
<p>Goal setting, project management, problem resolution, budgeting, evaluations are done by educated people - not trained people. <strong><a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2024/4/9/trained-or-educated.html">source: Blue Skunk blog</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>…preliminary research released earlier this month found that high-impact tutoring could increase attendance. A study by the National Student Support Accelerator at Stanford University discovered that Washington, D.C., students receiving high-impact tutoring were less likely to be absent on days they had sessions.</p>
<p>“These results highlight the multifaceted benefits of high-impact tutoring and its potential to address the widespread problem of chronic absenteeism in our schools,” said Susanna Loeb, founder and executive director of the Stanford center, in a statement.

<p>Apparently so, it IS about SEL and Teacher-Student relationships:</p>

			 <p>I have relied on Perplexity Pro ($20 or <strong><a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">$10 with this referral link</a></strong>) for awhile now, but had not given much thought or exploration time to the image generation features. That is, until today when Dr. Dru Stevenson <strong><a href="https://mastodon.education/@drustevenson@mastodon.social/112269470201658259">asked me on Mastodon</a></strong>, &ldquo;will it generate images?&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The answer, as you can see above, is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Not only that, but you can use several different AI models to get the job done:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Generating images is pretty easy, although you can only generate 50 a day with a Pro account. I can&rsquo;t believe I completely missed this and haven&rsquo;t been using it.</p>
<h2 id="generate-image-tools">Generate Image Tools</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Generate Image tools:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="a-quick-experiment">A Quick Experiment</h2>
<p>For fun, I uploaded a photo of myself to see if it could use DALL-E to adapt the photo into a watercolor painting. It was not able, giving this rationale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have the capability to generate a painting from the provided portrait photo. My primary function is to process and respond to text-based inputs. I do not have the ability to create, generate, edit, manipulate or produce visual content such as paintings, images, or artwork. If you are interested in having a painting created from this portrait photo, I would suggest exploring options with human artists or specialized image generation tools designed for that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a bummer. When I gave ChatGPT Plus the same prompt (shown below), it generated the image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Generate a watercolor paint from the attached portrait photo of me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="chatgpt-plus-image-generated">ChatGPT Plus Image Generated</h3>

<p>That is about what I expected from ChatGPT Plus with DALL-E. I had hoped for something similar from Perplexity Pro, but not yet.</p>

<p>Instead, Perplexity Pro allowed me to generate a watercolor painting:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What a disappointment with the current capabilities, but a big step forward regardless in image generation. No doubt, this will be the worst it can do&hellip;.</p>
<h2 id="perplexity-pro-on-image-generation">Perplexity Pro On Image Generation</h2>
<p>I asked Perplexity Pro a simple question (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->how can perplexity generate an image?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) about whether it could do the job, and it gave me this information:</p>
<p>Perplexity can generate an image through its AI technology, which is available for Perplexity Pro users on the web browser. Here&rsquo;s how the process works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the Feature</strong>: Once you have a Perplexity Pro subscription, you can generate images by waiting for the search response to finish generating. After that, on the right column next to the response, you will see the option to &ldquo;Generate Image&rdquo;[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choosing a Style</strong>: Click on &ldquo;Generate Image&rdquo; to begin the process. You will be presented with options for some pre-written styles. If you want to customize the image further, you can click on the icon next to &ldquo;Choose a style&rdquo; to apply your own prompt and give additional instructions[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generating the Image</strong>: After selecting the style and providing any additional instructions, you will have to wait for the image to be generated. Once it&rsquo;s done, the image will be displayed at the top of the column[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Selection</strong>: You can select from three different models to generate your image: Playground V2.5, DALL·E 3, or Stable Diffusion XL. The model can be switched from the settings page under the Pro section[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Limit</strong>: As a Perplexity Pro user, you can create up to 50 images per day[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commercial Use</strong>: Images generated through Perplexity&rsquo;s service are intended for personal, non-commercial use only, as per the Terms of Service[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: If you encounter an error while trying to generate an image, it could be due to explicit or moderated content in your query, an unstable connection, or a technical issue on Perplexity&rsquo;s end[1].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This feature is currently only available on the web browser and not on the mobile app[1].</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong><a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2024/4/12/autonomy-and-technology.html">Doug Johnson introduced me to a new quote</a></strong> from Christopher Hitchens. I&rsquo;d first run into Hitchen&rsquo;s Razor, which goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great quote and one of the first that went into my notebook on critical thinking. The quote Doug shares goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course we have free will because we have no choice but to have it.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="is-it-moral-or-ethical">Is It Moral or Ethical?</h2>
<p>Doug shares something that resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To me, the scary thing about AI is not intelligence, but independent decision-making. Or at least human’s willingness to give decision-making to our computer programs. Making moral decisions seems to be much trickier and more dangerous than, say, financial ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt, lots of folks are thinking about what is driving AI decision-making. For me, the question is whether people appreciate that an AI could develop a sense of ethics according to rules. To that end, to get a better understanding of AI ethics, I thought to start with Paul Paul Kurtz' <em><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forbidden-Fruit-Secularism-Paul-Kurtz/dp/1591026660">Forbidden Fruit: The Ethics of Secularism</a></strong></em>. Why start there you ask? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to expect AI to adhere to God-issued commandments about right and wrong. And, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to feed AI holy texts from world religions and see what it came up with.</p>
<h2 id="about-morality">About Morality</h2>
<p>Paul Kurtz points out that there are two kinds of morality:</p>
<ul>
<li>A morality of obedience to commandments allegedly derived from a transcendental theistic source</li>
<li>an ethics-based on the development of critical rational inquiry and insight</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;m curious about is, &ldquo;How do you prescribe ethics-based morality (non-theistic) to an AI model?&rdquo; I suppose you&rsquo;d have to write all the rules down, then have it follow those rules.</p>
<h2 id="wait-humans-cant-develop-a-moral-code">Wait, Humans Can&rsquo;t Develop a Moral Code</h2>
<p>For those folks who believe in God, AI must be doomed to commit atrocity. That&rsquo;s because people are responsible for setting up the parameters for the AI to follow. Those parameters must be flawed because they are not coming from an all-powerful being.</p>
<p>But I found Paul Kurtz' perspective on this enlightening. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since religious systems of morality are creations of human culture, invested and sustained by men, this belies the claim that human beings cannot by their own effort, create a moral code or behave morally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t like the moral code in the Bible or other holy texts, it&rsquo;s still kinda cool to think, &ldquo;Yeah, what we&rsquo;ve been ascribing to an all-powerful god? We did that.&rdquo; Kurtz goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is insufficient evidence for the existence of God. Therefore, the religious texts cannot have been revealed by a god. Rather these texts are simply the expressions of human beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-does-ai-make-of-world-religious-texts">What Does AI Make of World Religious Texts?</h2>
<p>For fun, I asked ChatGPT Plus to share five big takeaways after reading all the holy texts. It came back with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unity and Oneness</strong>: Many holy texts emphasize the fundamental unity of humanity and the oneness of God, advocating for universal compassion and understanding across diverse cultures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Frameworks</strong>: These texts often provide moral guidelines designed to shape ethical human behavior, underscoring virtues like honesty, charity, and forgiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purpose of Life</strong>: They frequently explore the meaning of life and the human role in the universe, suggesting that life has a purpose guided by divine will or cosmic order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consequences of Actions</strong>: A recurring theme is the concept of accountability for one&rsquo;s actions, with promises of reward or punishment in an afterlife based on earthly conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spiritual Practice</strong>: Encouragement of regular spiritual practices (like prayer, meditation, or pilgrimage) is common, serving as a means to cultivate a deeper connection with the divine and to foster personal growth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So given that, what are five ethical guidelines AI&rsquo;s are to follow? Here&rsquo;s the response:
Here are five ethical guidelines that I, as an AI, am designed to adhere to, and how they compare with human secular ethics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Neutrality and Impartiality</strong>: I strive to provide unbiased information, maintaining a neutral stance without personal or cultural biases, unlike human secular ethics which can be influenced by personal or cultural perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: I treat all interactions as private, not storing personal data or details, a principle similar to human ethical standards around privacy, but applied strictly and without exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety and Non-maleficence</strong>: I aim to prevent harm and ensure user safety by filtering harmful content and providing accurate information, paralleling the human ethical principle of &ldquo;do no harm&rdquo; but executed through predefined programming guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility and Inclusivity</strong>: I am designed to be accessible to all users, offering information in an inclusive manner that seeks to bridge knowledge gaps, which is a broader and more systematic application of the human principle of equality and inclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accuracy and Reliability</strong>: I commit to providing fact-based and precise information, constantly updated through algorithms, which is akin to human commitments to truthfulness but reliant on algorithmic updates and data veracity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a moment to reflect on what that AI model, ChatGPT  said. Now, compare it to Anthrop\c&rsquo;s Claude.ai via Perplexity Pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an AI assistant, I do not personally adhere to any particular ethical framework, whether secular or religious. I was created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest.</p>
<p>However, based on the provided search results, there are a few key points about AI ethics from a secular perspective:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many AI developers and companies operate from a secular, preference-utilitarian ethical framework focused on maximizing the fulfillment of human preferences. This approach has limitations and is open to objections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dominant secular view is that morality is subjective and made up by humans, rather than based on objective, transcendent principles. This raises challenges for determining what ethical principles AI systems should follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without an objective moral framework, it becomes difficult to evaluate and compare different ethical perspectives for AI. Companies driven by profit may make questionable ethical choices in AI development if they view ethics as arbitrary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous secular organizations have proposed ethical AI frameworks consisting of principles like transparency, fairness, privacy, accountability, etc. However, there is debate about the degree to which machines can truly be considered ethical agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some argue AI ethics requires an objective moral standard, possibly grounded in religious tradition, rather than a purely secular foundation of subjective human preferences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, I aim to be helpful and avoid harm in my interactions, but I do not have personal ethical beliefs. There are significant challenges and open questions around developing robust secular foundations for ethical AI. Engaging with religious perspectives may provide valuable insights to complement secular approaches.</p>
<h2 id="review-our-understanding">Review Our Understanding</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but agree with Doug that this is the time, as he says below, to reflect on our own sense of ethics. I sense a war between belief and non-belief coming, as believers grow more and more desperate to push their own perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that the development and spread of AI is an excellent time to review our understandings about moral decision-making, free will, and self-preservation. Perhaps we might better understand ourselves by asking how our creations might act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this perspective, I must confess to a bit of concern. Critical thinking, evidence-based actions, skeptical thinking, are hard work. It&rsquo;s far easier to be told what to do, which is something I noticed even as a Catholic in year one of university studies, staving off the testimonials and admonitions of born again fundamentalists of every stripe. To contemplate non-belief as an option then was to jump off a cliff. Now, it is a reasoned choice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why ethics is so important. Secular ethics. Ethics made by people that affirms the best of who we are, and pushes us to reconcile with the worst.</p>

			 <p>What a warm winter it&rsquo;s been. That&rsquo;s on top of a hot hot hot summer. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that this chart from the University of Maine reflects rising sea surface temperatures.</p>

<p>What an eye opening post with data that should make everyone sit up and take notice. Check out the lead on this piece, <em><strong><a href="https://www.splinter.com/the-climate-charts-are-not-okay">The Climate Charts Are Not OK</a></strong></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chart looks wrong. It looks like a malign mistake, or like two separate charts have been combined in some nefarious way. Like an abomination made mundane through math&hellip;The charts are hilariously underpowered attempts to depict just how out-of-balance we have rendered the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a shocker, right? &ldquo;How out-of-balance&rdquo; humans &ldquo;have rendered the world.&rdquo; What a slap in the face for humanity. Instead of making things better, we trashed the Earth, its oceans, like some crazy band trashing a hotel room.</p>
<p>The author of this piece, Dave Levitan, is doing his best to grab our attention. Why? This chart that shows something horrible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not just the oceans, of course. Last year was the warmest year in recorded history, and probably in at least 125,000 years. The U.S. saw more billion-dollar weather disasters in 2023 – 28 of them, from Hurricane Idalia in Florida to the Maui wildfires – than in any previous year. Antarctic sea ice cratered to unprecedented levels in 2023. The list of the ten warmest years on record includes each of the last ten years; ten years from now, it will presumably contain only those ten years, give or take an outlier from the current list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you see the chart, you realize, &ldquo;Oh, heck. He&rsquo;s right. We have goofed things up.&rdquo; The only thing Dave Levitan fails to offer is hope for a better tomorrow. In fact, it&rsquo;s not only going to get worse, our current efforts are insufficient to the task of making things better.</p>

			 <p>Paying for college as I approach retirement isn&rsquo;t something I hoped for, but it is something that became necessary. I always knew I would be paying for, or assisting my children, in paying for college. Not earning a degree has never been an option. In fact, I always encouraged my children to get advanced degrees. It&rsquo;s only recently that I&rsquo;ve opened that up to some kind of trade school or additional certifications, if only because wiser minds prevailed against my bias.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From my perspective, having a degree makes a HUGE difference in your lifelong earning power. It&rsquo;s easy to say when you&rsquo;re young, &ldquo;I can do this work the rest of my life,&rdquo; but anyone who is older knows the truth. There&rsquo;s a little less pep in your step as you get older, and you never know what curve balls life will throw at you.</p>
<p>I am grateful to President Joe Biden for assisting with holding back the interest on my offspring&rsquo;s college loan. While I&rsquo;m paying it back, knowing that the interest won&rsquo;t be doubling or tripling that debt while I do so, is a big relief. For those who object to these efforts, I remind you that the goal is to educate as many of our populace as possible. The better educated, the better we will all be. The less educated, the worse off. At least, that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>

<p>Have you encountered obstacles in achieving your goal? Do you imagine that once you achieve a certain pinnacle, it will all be OK from that point forward? No more issues or things getting in your way of being happy or worry-free? That&rsquo;s not how life works, but you know, I thought it was for a long time when I was a younger dude. This suggests to me that I lived a life of privilege, and only came to understand the world after a long time.</p>
<p>This Haitian proverb, quoted on the page, <strong><a href="https://store.dailystoic.com/products/the-obstacle-is-the-way-medallion?variant=8031142346782">The Obstacle is The Way</a></strong>, is absolutely wonderful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind mountains are more mountains. One does not overcome one obstacle only to enter the land of no obstacles. No matter how successful we are or will be, we’re going to find things that stand in our path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That saying is right on target. You know, I didn&rsquo;t understand that fundamental truth when I was younger. I thought, &ldquo;If I work really hard, I&rsquo;ll get to the top of the mountain, and that will be that. I&rsquo;ll have it made.&rdquo; I suppose I could quote my Dad, who said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it made, you&rsquo;ve got it to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my misapprehension of how the world works was something I didn&rsquo;t get corrected until later in life.
Ryan Holiday paraphrases or quotes Marcus Aurelius:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The impediment to action advances action, what stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>

<p>I suspect that my fears about retirement are like my misapprehensions about success. You don&rsquo;t just retire and achieve perfect bliss. Instead, you have a whole new set of challenges that you have to work through. As such, maybe it&rsquo;s better to not retire, and keep on doing.

<h1 id="3-2-1">3-2-1</h1>
<p>The mysterious and concerning phenomenon of strange fish behavior in the Florida Keys, particularly affecting the endangered smalltooth sawfish, has captured the attention of researchers, conservationists, and the public alike. Here&rsquo;s a concise breakdown of the situation:</p>
<h3 id="3-key-facts-about-the-strange-fish-behavior">3 Key Facts about the Strange Fish Behavior:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Widespread Phenomenon</strong>: Over 40 different fish species, including the critically endangered smalltooth sawfish, have been observed exhibiting unusual behaviors such as spinning, whirling, and swimming upside down in the waters near the Lower Florida Keys[12][17]. This abnormal behavior has raised alarms among scientists and conservationists due to its potential impact on marine life and ecosystem health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sawfish Mortality</strong>: More than 28 dead smalltooth sawfish have been recorded as of late March 2024, with the true death toll likely higher since the bodies of these large fish typically sink[12]. Given the limited population size of smalltooth sawfish, this mortality rate could significantly impact the recovery of the species, which has been federally protected as endangered since 2003[13][14].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigations and Response</strong>: The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), in collaboration with NOAA and other organizations, is actively investigating the cause of the abnormal fish behavior and sawfish deaths. Despite ruling out several potential triggers, such as bacterial infections, algal toxins, and environmental factors like temperature and salinity, the exact cause remains unknown[12][17][18][19]. An emergency response effort to rescue affected sawfish is underway, marking the first attempt to save this species from an unknown threat[12].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-concerns-raised-by-the-phenomenon">2 Concerns Raised by the Phenomenon:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on Endangered Species</strong>: The smalltooth sawfish, already listed as endangered and the first marine fish to receive federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, faces a new and immediate threat from this mysterious phenomenon[13][14]. The loss of even a small number of individuals could hinder the species' fragile recovery efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ecosystem Health</strong>: The widespread and unexplained behavior affecting a broad range of fish species suggests a potential underlying issue with the marine ecosystem in the Florida Keys[12][17]. This situation underscores the importance of maintaining healthy and balanced marine environments to support diverse marine life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-urgent-need">1 Urgent Need:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifying the Cause</strong>: The most pressing need is to identify the cause of the strange fish behavior and sawfish deaths. Understanding the underlying factors is crucial for developing effective interventions to mitigate the impact on affected species and prevent future occurrences. Ongoing research, public reporting of sightings, and collaborative efforts among governmental and conservation organizations are vital components of the response strategy[12][17][18][19].</li>

<p>Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions. It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in our heads and see which best fit the facts.

science has built-in, error-correcting machinery at its very heart.

<p>Science, Ann Druyan notes, is forever whispering in our ears, ‘Remember, you’re very new at this. You might be mistaken. You’ve been wrong before.’ Despite all the talk of humility, show me something comparable in religion. Scripture is said to be divinely inspired - a phrase with many meanings. But what if it’s simply made up by fallible humans?</p>
<p>Which leaders of the major faiths acknowledge that their beliefs might be incomplete or erroneous and establish institutes to uncover possible doctrinal deficiencies? Beyond the test of everyday living, who is systematically testing the circumstances in which traditional religious teachings may no longer apply? (It is certainly conceivable that doctrines and ethics that may have worked fairly well in patriarchal or patristic or medieval times might be thoroughly invalid in the very different world we inhabit today.) What sermons even-handedly examine the God hypothesis?
What rewards are religious sceptics given by the established religions - or, for that matter, social and economic sceptics by the society in which they swim?</p>

<h2 id="bookshelves">BookShelves</h2>
<p>I have to admit that I like the BookShelves option to track the books I&rsquo;m reading. Why? You can import a list of books you&rsquo;ve read or are currently reading (or want to read) via a comma-separated values (CSV) file. That means, you can prepare the list in your favorite spreadsheet, then export it as a CSV file for import into Micro Blogs' Bookshelves, to make tracking what you&rsquo;re reading so easy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a partial list of some of my most recent reads in a CSV viewer (CSV Buddy v3.0), an export out of Micro Blogs' Bookshelves.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to update the list in the spreadsheet tool of choice (OnlyOffice) then upload the completed list. What convenience this is, to add books to my list whether through the web, an app, or via CSV upload.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>These features appearing in ONE solution, Micro Blogs, is wonderful. This is simply amazing. More people need to know about this. Spread the word.</p>

			 <p>Over at Book Riot, this unbelievable piece of news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HB 777 was introduced March 25 by Representative Kellee Dickerson, who helped fund the Louisiana Freedom Caucus. The bill would criminalize library workers and libraries for joining the American Library Association.</p>
<p>The American Library Association (ALA) is the largest and oldest professional organization for library workers in the nation. It was founded in 1876, and this Twitter thread is a fantastic resource on the history and purpose of the organization. <strong><a href="https://bookriot.com/louisiana-hb-777/">Read more</a></strong></p>

<p>Seriously, you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up. Looks like I&rsquo;ll have to go pay dues to ALA simply to help support them. I encourage you to do the same.</p>

			 <h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Think Like Socrates&rdquo; is an inspiring guide to using Socratic questioning in the classroom. Peeples shares relatable stories that show how this method sparks curiosity and empathy. She makes a strong case for prioritizing authentic dialogue over rote learning. The book&rsquo;s best parts explore how Socratic seminars build vital social-emotional skills.</p>
<p>Peeples offers troubleshooting tips for common challenges. Her infectious passion will energize teachers to revitalize their practice with the power of questioning. Whether you&rsquo;re new to Socratic seminars or a veteran, this concise, readable book is a valuable resource to transform your teaching.</p>
<h2 id="honoring-students-experiences">Honoring Students' Experiences</h2>
<p>Over the last few days, I&rsquo;ve been huddled up with Shanna Peeples’ book, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Socrates-Questions-Essentials/dp/1506391648">Think Like Socrates</a></strong>. The book jacket a la Amazon advertises it in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Socrates believed in the power of questions rather than lecturing his students. But how did we get so far away from his method of inquiry? Shanna Peeples, 2015 National Teacher of the Year, will show you how teachers can create an engaging atmosphere that encourages student questions and honors their experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-i-hoped-for-from-this-book">What I Hoped For From This Book</h2>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been reading a bit about Socrates, Stoics, Philosophy, etc., my hope was that this book would be a re-introduction of critical thinking, the dialogic method into modern classrooms. Today, there is a fundamental desire to strip classrooms down to bare bones, dumping a lot of the ways things have been done in the recent past, to get back to&hellip;well&hellip;basics of teaching and learning. Of course, to do that without also throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Peeples' book gave off strong writing workshop vibes (and it referenced writing workshop several times). I recognized it from my own efforts at writing workshop. She drops beautiful statements that capture the reader&rsquo;s attention a la social justice. It is an authentic telling, very social and emotional learning friendly with echoes of culturally responsive teaching. That said, the title is off. I wouldn&rsquo;t have called this readable, conversational text &ldquo;Think Like Socrates.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="quoting-peebles">Quoting Peebles</h2>
<p>You can easily tell Peebles was a journalist, and an English teacher. She will occasionally drop these amazing statements into the text that make you sit up and take notice. This book could have been condensed to a few pages of these engaging statements, and the lesson protocols she includes.</p>
<p>Here are Peebles' amazing statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our students need to ask questions now more than ever. To shield them from thinking and questioning in a mistaken fear of “pulling them off task” is at best wasted effort and at worst an isolation from what truly makes us human.</p>
<p>In a world increasingly uncomfortable with the changes wrought by technology, we seek out authoritarian figures to tell us what to do and how to think.</p>
<p>Questioning, therefore is good citizenship. It is the anti-tyranny vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, consider this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our basic human drives is connection. We become smarter by participating in social learning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You just know Peebles is taking aim those restrictive efforts in schools that try to silence children. I love this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can&rsquo;t order, threaten or guilt people to innovate. We can be systematic in creating the conditions and systems for innovation to regularly happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are ideas that echo and rise above the title and confines of the book. They scream out for more attention. Here are a few more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe what students really want is for us to listen to them and trust the intellectual power inside them.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Writing is a way to be present with your own experiences.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>The book, with it&rsquo;s authentic writing, hits the mark on SEL and building safe learning environments, teacher-student relationships, but&hellip;I kept hoping for more practical suggestions on Socratic thinking than what Peebles offered in the included lesson protocols. I may have misunderstood what Peeples set out to do&hellip;I guess I wanted more Socrates, more on Socratic circles, and critical thinking. This text tried to cover too much, and ended up with a field of coal with a few gems throughout. I would have encouraged a more concise volume.</p>
<p>That misunderstanding aside, a fantastic read, well worth the time to seek out the diamonds Peebles scatters amidst the ideas in the book.</p>
<h2 id="quotable-quotes">Quotable Quotes</h2>
<p>These are quotes that Peeples included in her book. I liked some of them, so they appear here out of context.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The biggest problem growing up today is not actually stress; it&rsquo;s meaninglessness.&rdquo; - William Damon, Professor</li>
<li>&ldquo;True life is lived when tiny changes occur.&rdquo; &ndash;Leo Tolstoy</li>
<li>&ldquo;We learn an art by doing that which we wish to do when we have learned of it; we become builders by building, and harpers by harping. And so by doing just acts we become just, and by doing acts of temperance and courage, we become temperate and courageous.&rdquo; - Aristotle</li>
<li>&ldquo;To believe that one can teach respect through coercion is to confuse respect with obedience.&rdquo; Larry Brendtro and Nicholas Long, Reclaiming Children and Youth</li>
<li>&ldquo;The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences and like Teflon for positive ones.&rdquo; -Rick Hanson</li>
<li>&ldquo;The task is not so much to see what no one yet has seen but to think what nobody yet has thought about that which everybody sees.&rdquo; -Arthur Schopenhauer</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of philosophy&ndash;it has been spreading love and advancing human ideas for centuries. Be afraid of a world without philosophy. Be afraid of what you will become if you turn your back on the beautiful possibilities it has to offer.&rdquo; - Sharon Kaye</li>
<li>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t teach science as a bunch of facts. We have to teach them how to ask good questions and think like a scientist.&rdquo; Randolph ?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Men have no more ready corrective of conduct than knowledge of the past.&rdquo; -Polybius</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-notes">My Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we make a space for students to ask their own questions, we validate them as meaning-makers and honor the hardwired capacity for inquiry that is in each of us.</li>
<li>Socrates believed that inviting people to question what they think they know, rather than telling them would result in deeper understanding.</li>
<li>The dialectic method compels one to think through a problem to a logical conclusion&hellip;it involves using questions to help students draw from the well of what they know, match it against what they have learned, interrogate it, and build deeper understanding.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>An opening for professional development sessions with teachers is: <em>What do you struggle with the most as a teacher?&quot;</em></li>
<li>When we encourage natural social behaviors, we are making ourselves and our learning experiences necessary.</li>
<li>The fastest way to engage people&rsquo;s brains is to ask it a question.</li>
<li>When students make predictions about content, even content they don&rsquo;t know, they must have an answer. If teachers set up students' questions in a way that points toward the content they need to teach, teachers enlist students' natural tendency to find answers to deeper learning experiences. These experiences allow them to develop their vocabulary, speaking, listening, writing, reading, and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li>One of our basic human drives is connection. We become smarter by participating in social learning, according to Vygotsky&rsquo;s social development theory.</li>
<li>The theory emphasizes the importance of the learning environment in determining how children think and what they think about.</li>
<li>An opening to a session by the author:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I accept that bad things happen to good people. What I can&rsquo;t accept is when good things happen to bad people. Why do some people &lsquo;get away with it?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a question that haunts me. What about you? What are the questions that haunt you? Or make you sad? or make you angry? Or just confuse you no matter how much you try to think about it?
I&rsquo;ve asked your teachers to give everyone a piece of paper. I&rsquo;d love to know what your questions are. What are the things you&rsquo;ve kept inside you that you&rsquo;ve been afraid to ask? Would you mind sharing them with me? If you want to, please write them on the paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Maybe what students really want is for us to listen to them and trust the intellectual power inside them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>We can&rsquo;t order, threaten or guilt people to innovate. We can be systematic in creating the conditions and systems for innovation to regularly happen.</li>
<li>Design thinking is a continual action always in search of newer and better ways to solve problems. It uses analysis to separate a problem into pieces as in&hellip;.</li>
<li>Divergent thinking creates multiple perspectives and generates many kinds of solutions. An easy way to start is to use cubing. A question (a total of six) goes on each side of the cube.</li>
<li>After cubing, use convergent thinking that brings together all of the information gleaned from cubing or other brainstorming exercises to focus on the most promising ideas.</li>
<li>If we want kids to connect with the heart of learning, we have to risk the messiness of it. The risk is the reward.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cubing-design-strategy">Cubing Design Strategy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Describe it, Think about it, Try it</li>
<li>Compare/Contrast It, Think About it, Try it</li>
<li>Associate it&hellip;.</li>
<li>Analyze it&hellip;</li>
<li>Apply it&hellip;</li>
<li>Argue for or against it&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>This stance&ndash;teaching from who we are and connecting to those who are in front of us&ndash;is what raises teaching from a set of discrete skills into the realm of something only humans can do.</li>
<li>It calls on us to be unguarded, empathetic, authentic, and brave.</li>
<li>When you find five similarities with your students, Harvard researchers found, the relationship between teachers and students improves by over 60%.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>The process of writing in short burst is easy, but committing to it as a daily practice is more difficult.</li>
<li>==Writing is a way to be present with your own experiences.==</li>
<li>A set of sentence stems to use includes:</li>
<li>What I&rsquo;m feeling right now&hellip;</li>
<li>I hate/ I love</li>
<li>What I wish people understood is&hellip;</li>
<li>What I&rsquo;m wondering about is&hellip;</li>
<li>Talk less; ask more questions</li>
<li>A magic phrase for beginning difficult conversations is, ==&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on that I need to know? What do you need me to understand? Can you say more about that?&quot;==</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-notes-from-subsequent-chapters">Miscellaneous Notes from Subsequent Chapters</h3>
<p>Some additional items from my notes and the book, but there&rsquo;s a lot more to consider that would take a lot more time than I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>In my class, there are a few questions that I ask all the time: &ldquo;1) What is this telling us? 2) How does it connect to what we already know? 3) Why does that matter to us as citizens and us as individuals?&rdquo; - Nate Bowling</li>
<li>Asking questions, defining problems, and engaging in argument from evidence are core practices.</li>
<li>When engaging in inquiry, students describe objects and events, ask questions, construct explanations, test those explanations, against current scientific knowledge, and communicate their ideas to others.</li>
<li>Students identify their assumptions, use critical and logical thinking and consider alternative explanations. In this way, students actively develop their understanding of science by combining scientific knowledge with reasoning and thinking skills.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>So fun to see one’s work through another’s eyes. I was playing with words, as writers do, and whipped this up late one evening before sleeping. As I read it now, again, I see the driftwood of my past mixing with the incoming tide of change. 🤣 Too much fun. 🤓</p>
<p>In responding to my original comment (Doug did a comment hoist of the comment I left on his <em>I miss snow</em> post), <strong><a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2024/4/3/a-poetic-response.html">Doug Johnson writes</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As all good writing should do, Miguel’s clever, mystical response to my post made me reflect, made me think about things I might not otherwise have considered. I was, quite frankly, a bit mesmorized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being mesmerized certainly is a wonderful reaction to anything one writes, but it was this next part that made me go, &ldquo;Hmm&hellip;.&rdquo; See what Doug writes below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don’t we respond lyrically more often? Would we be more convincing, more sympathetic? Might others pay more attention to us if the style of the message was as interesting as the content?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, going &ldquo;lyrical&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound like a bad thing. Sure, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it in the workplace except as a stunt, but on personal blogs like <em>Another Think Coming</em>, it sounds like a wonderful thing to do.</p>
<h2 id="lyrical-version-of-this-blog-post">Lyrical Version of This Blog Post</h2>
<p>Courtesy of AI, here&rsquo;s a lyrical version of the words in this blog post:</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an attempt to capture the essence of your comment in a whimsical, lyrical format without reproducing any copyrighted lyrics:</p>
<h2 id="lyrical-musings">Lyrical Musings</h2>
<p>Verse 1:
Words dance upon the page, a writer&rsquo;s play
Driftwood memories mingle with the changing tide
Clever musings take shape, mystical in their sway
Inviting one to ponder, reflect, and abide</p>
<p>Chorus:
Why don&rsquo;t we respond with lyrical grace?
Let melodies convey our truth and feeling
Perhaps if wrapped in music&rsquo;s warm embrace
Our messages would find a deeper meaning</p>
<p>Verse 2:
In this space to freely write and roam
Might lyrical blogs be a wondrous trail?
A personal verse, a metaphoric home
Where sympathetic lines could set sail</p>
<p>Chorus:
Why don&rsquo;t we respond with lyrical grace?
Let melodies convey our truth and feeling
Perhaps if wrapped in music&rsquo;s warm embrace
Our messages would find a deeper meaning</p>
<p>Bridge:
Workplaces may frown on such whimsical stunts
But in our own realms, let words take flight
Soaring high on poetry&rsquo;s uplifting currents
Illuminating thoughts with lyrical light</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to capture the sense of playfully considering a more lyrical writing style, especially in personal spaces, while avoiding any copyrighted material. The lyrics imagine the potential for deeper meaning and connection through a lyrical approach. Let me know if you&rsquo;d like me to modify or expand on this lyrical response in any way.</p>

			 <p>Are you <strong><a href="https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/handgun-licensing">licensed to carry</a></strong>? I often reflect that it&rsquo;s better to stay home and not go out given the Wild West scenario. But you know what? The Wild West wasn&rsquo;t this crazy. Schoolhouses were respected.</p>
<p>After Sandy Hook, and several other school shootings, it became evident that &ldquo;thoughts and prayers&rdquo; approach to this topic wasn&rsquo;t getting the job done. What&rsquo;s more, the gun lobby&rsquo;s considerable influence and money encouraged politicians from doing the right thing (banning assault weapons for purchase).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After Uvalde&rsquo;s school shooting, I thought that there had been enough young lives, not to mention the lives of educators, sacrificed on the altar of protecting against school shooting. I hoped that substantive change might result. But it appears the gun lobby, the politicians allied with them, continue to soldier on.</p>
<p>As a result, many educators I know decided to arm themselves, to ensure that they would have some way to defend their children, even if it meant defying the law to carry in school buildings. One of them, a deputy superintendent (now retired), said to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to defend myself and others if somebody comes in here to harm us.&rdquo; And, looking in the eyes of that silver-haired grandmother, I believed her.</p>

<p>Awhile back, I <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/25/mynotes-the-scientific.html">wrote the following about Prevagen</a></strong>, that memory drug commercial. They keep running it when I&rsquo;m watching television, and it irritates me to no end. No doubt, I&rsquo;m suffering from <strong>frequency illusion</strong>, or <strong>Baader-Meinhof phenomenon</strong>.</p>
<p>After you read this blog entry, you will suffer it, too!
;-)</p>
<h2 id="vocabulary-clarification---frequency-illusion">Vocabulary Clarification - Frequency Illusion</h2>
<p>When you learn something new, it stays fresh in your mind. You start paying more attention to it than other things since your brain has decided this is important. Then, confirmation bias (ugh!) kicks in, and your mind searches for this newly learned information to confirm your new knowledge. You notice every instance of it, but the reality is, it&rsquo;s not appearing more&hellip;you are noticing it more.</p>
<p>A fun trick might be to teach someone something new, then see if that&rsquo;s all they focus on for the next hour. Too much fun. Anyways, you can imagine what a pain it is to become aware of how bad anecdotes are, then have to put up with television commercials that appeal to you using anecdotes.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-prevagen">Back To Prevagen</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time I see Prevagen commercial on television, I’m intrigued. Wouldn’t it be neat to have a drug that could magically restore my memory? No longer would I reach for a word and have it just out of grasp. However, the scientific consensus reveals this miracle memory restorer leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Prevagen commercials, like others that appear on television, are an appeal via anecdotes. It&rsquo;s the old trick of getting a dentist to advertise toothpaste, or a pharmacist to recommend an over the counter drug that may not be effective at all.</p>
<h2 id="personal-experience-can-lead-you-astray">Personal Experience Can Lead You Astray</h2>
<p>Today, I ran into <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=840635281394504&amp;set=a.482178513906851">Melanie Trecek-King&rsquo;s Facebook post</a></strong> (be sure to check out the comments, too), where she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As critical thinkers, our goal is to use evidence to decide what to believe. And as such, we need to be skeptical of anecdotal evidence for several reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article she lists is worth reading, <strong><a href="https://thinkingispower.com/four-ways-your-personal-experiences-can-lead-you-astray/">Four Ways Your Personal Experience Can Lead You Astray</a></strong>. In the article she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anecdotes are personal experiences that are used as evidence for a claim. Our brains jump to conclusions and assume the experience is a good indicator of what’s typical and even that events are due to causation. Vivid and emotional stories are often particularly convincing and memorable.</p>
<p>Many people think that anecdotes are a sure-fire way of knowing what’s true. Indeed, it can be quite difficult to convince someone that they might be wrong.</p>
<p>But anecdotes are infamously unreliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation Bias</h2>
<p>How do you push back against confirmation bias? How do you stop it from hijacking your brain? Here are a few ideas I found interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question your motivations</strong>. This is a great one that reminds me of Crucial Confrontations. Why are you doing this? What&rsquo;s motivating you? Are you emotionally invested?</li>
<li><strong>Consider Opposite POVs</strong>. What&rsquo;s an opposite point of view, and what&rsquo;s the reasoning behind it? I remember hearing the guest on the <strong>Thinking Clearly</strong> <strong><a href="https://thinkingclearly.libsyn.com/92-election-2024-preparation-4-teaching-critical-thinking-to-american-military-future-leaders-with-guest-stephen-gerras">podcast recently explore this idea</a></strong>. Their guest shares how they do it at the Army War College, which involves writing five bullet points torpedoing their perspective. Dig deeper into opposing perspectives and write them out.</li>
<li><strong>Get feedback from others</strong>. Be transparent about your thinking process and what conclusions you came up with. Sure, you may look stupid, but better to look stupid to a few folks than to the world. Of course, if you&rsquo;re a blogger, being transparent (and wrong) is part of the fun&hellip;one of the reasons people don&rsquo;t really blog, they just &ldquo;publish&rdquo; information and pieces that people agree with (or not).</li>
<li><strong>Engage in systematic disconfirmation</strong>. You may have read <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/12/be-sure-to.html">this blog entry I wrote systematic disconfirmation</a></strong> but if you haven&rsquo;t, check it out. You are on the hunt to find credible evidence and data that goes against your existing belief. Since confirmation bias is about finding information that supports your belief, this process is the exact opposite.</li>

<p>You know, I <strong>want</strong> there to be a memory-enhancing drug. Like almost everyone I know, when I reach for a word sometimes, it doesn&rsquo;t show up or appear right away. I&rsquo;ll be sitting on the couch or exercising, and &ldquo;Wham!&rdquo; the word I was reaching for in a conversation shows up with a jolly &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here! Aren&rsquo;t you happy?&rdquo; But the truth is, I&rsquo;m NOT happy.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when government tries to legislate religion, beliefs, and stamp out diversity, equity, and inclusion in PUBLIC universities&hellip;well, it makes me very nervous.</p>
<h2 id="fascism-and-higher-education">Fascism and Higher Education</h2>
<p>I found <strong><a href="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/archives/1939/06/163-6/132419199.pdf">this read in The Atlantic (1939)</a></strong> quite eye-opening. The opening paragraph serves as a powerful reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The early Americans were determined that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->education should be free from political control<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Being liberals in the original and true sense of the term, they believed in the integrity of the individual as opposed to the despotism of the state.</p>
<p>This integrity or dignity of the individual was, of course, basic in democracy.</p>
<p>Among other things, it implied the right of the citizenry to think independently, to seek truth honestly, and to determine without political interference what should constitute the education of their children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting in The Atlantic article is this section outlining the real purpose of schooling. I hear echoes of these words in today&rsquo;s complaints about schools and teachers who aren&rsquo;t allowed to teach certain subjects or broach certain topics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We renounce international science. We renounce the international republic of learning. W e renounce research for its own sake.
We teach and learn medicine, not to increase the num ber of known microbes, but to keep the German people strong and
healthy.
We teach and learn history, not to say how things actually happened, b u t to instruct the German people from the past.
We teach and learn the sciences, not to discover abstract laws, but to sharpen the implements of the German people in their competition with other peoples.</p>
<p>The conclusion seems inevitable that state support of the German universities prepared the way for their immediate use by the totalitarian state, and that the universities were consequently of little value in maintaining the privileges of democracy or the rights of constitutional government. This was equally true in Italy and Russia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine if this were written for today. It&rsquo;s not that hard, is it?</p>
<h2 id="a-texas-version">A Texas Version</h2>
<p>The following is suggested by the current culture in Texas. It&rsquo;s an experiment, using AI, to reflect our current state of affairs. How well do you think this experiment reflects reality in Texas today, 2024?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We renounce liberal indoctrination. We renounce the teaching of critical race theory. We renounce social agendas in the classroom.</p>
<p>We teach and learn history, not to make students feel guilt or shame, but to promote the positive aspects of the United States and Texas.</p>
<p>We teach and learn social studies, not to focus on America&rsquo;s flaws, but to foster patriotism, citizenship and respect for our founding principles.</p>
<p>We teach and learn the sciences, not to push political ideologies, but to provide students the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, while respecting the right of parents to direct the moral upbringing of their children.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The revisions aim to capture the sentiment expressed by Texas political leaders that schools should avoid &ldquo;indoctrinating&rdquo; students with perceived liberal viewpoints and instead focus curriculum on instilling pride in Texas and American history and values, while giving parents more say over sensitive topics.[5][17] Recent laws have sought to ban the teaching of &ldquo;critical race theory&rdquo; and limit how issues like racism are discussed in classrooms.[13][16] The State Board of Education is currently in the process of revising social studies standards, with some arguing for more emphasis on the positive aspects of U.S. history and &ldquo;American exceptionalism.&quot;[13][17].

<h2 id="how-fascism-will-come">How Fascism Will Come</h2>
<p>Consider Terry Ehret&rsquo;s poem quoted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="how-fascism-will-come-1">How Fascism Will Come</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.&rdquo;
—attributed to Sinclair Lewis</p>
<p>When fascism comes, it will greet us with a smile. It will get down on its knees to pray. It will praise Main Street and Wall Street. It will cheer for the home team. It will clap from the bleachers when the uninsured are left to die on the street. It will rally on the Washington Mall. It will raise monuments to its heroes and weep for them and place bouquets at their stone feet and trace with their fingers the names engraved on the granite wall and go on sending soldiers to die in the mountains of Afghanistan, in the deserts of Iraq. It will send doves to pluck out the eyes of its enemies, having no hawks to spare.</p>
<p>When fascism comes, it will sit down for tea with the governor of Texas. It will pee in the mosques from California to Tennessee, chanting, &ldquo;Wake up America, the enemy is here.&rdquo; It will sing the anthems of corporatization, privatization, demonization, monopolization. It will be interviewed, lovingly, on talk radio. It&rsquo;ll have talking points and a Facebook page and a disdain for big words or hard consonants. It won&rsquo;t bother to read. It will shred all its books. It will lambast the teachers and outlaw the unions.</p>
<p>When fascism comes, it will look good. It will have big hair, pressed suits, lapel pins. It will control all the channels. It will ride in on Swift Boats. It will sit on the Supreme Court. It will court us with fear. It will woo us with hope. When fascism comes, it will sell shares of itself on the stock market. It will get rich, then it will get obscenely rich, then it will stop paying taxes. It will leave us in the dust. It will kick our ass. It won&rsquo;t have to break a sweat to fool us twice. It will be too big to fail.</p>
<p>When fascism comes to America, it will enter on the winds of our silence and indifference and complacency. And on that day, one hundred thousand poets will gather. In book stores and libraries, bars and cafes, in their houses and apartments, in schools and on street corners, they will gather. In Albania, Bangladesh, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Finland, Guatemala, Hungary, Macedonia, Malawi, Qatar, crying, laughing, screaming. They will wrap the sad music of humanity in bits of word cloth and hang them, like prayers, on the tree of life.

<h2 id="fighting-fascism">Fighting Fascism</h2>
<p>How do you fight fascism? It&rsquo;s unthinkable to imagine that any American would need to know how in their own country or state. Some suggest the steps might be as &ldquo;easy&rdquo; as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and confront fascist movements early.</li>
<li>Build broad coalitions against fascism that cross political and social lines.</li>
<li>Engage in direct action and counter-protests to disrupt fascist organizing.</li>
<li>Promote anti-fascist education to inoculate the public against fascist ideas.</li>
<li>Address the underlying social and economic conditions that fuel fascism&rsquo;s rise, like economic insecurity, social atomization and distrust in institutions.</li>
<li>Avoid appealing to the government or state to restrict fascists' free speech rights, as these tools are often turned against the left. Instead, anti-fascists should use their own free speech to counter fascist arguments and organize grassroots opposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but all of those approaches give me cause for concern. It&rsquo;s like watching a rash grow. But imagine you can&rsquo;t stop it&rsquo;s growth, there&rsquo;s no one else to tell you what to do, and it&rsquo;s late Sunday evening, and you know Monday (and relief) is a long way off. Maybe gangrene is a better analogy.</p>
<p>How many of us are &ldquo;fair-weather Americans?&rdquo; You know, Americans until the going gets fascist?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you stay so calm?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a question I get often. The truth is, there are times when I have to master my temper before it results in something bad. Staying in better shape, being more in touch with my emotions, helps me do that. It&rsquo;s gotten better over time, but these days, I ask myself the question, &ldquo;Why did THIS make you angry?&rdquo; I keep asking questions of myself until I understand why I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;almost&rdquo; lost my temper. I&rsquo;m not saint, though. It takes me a long time to get angry, and I have to have evidence you&rsquo;re out to get me for whatever the reason. I suppose that I can&rsquo;t abide liars, people who don&rsquo;t do what they said they would do. Of course, I suffer from those faults myself. Everyone does, no? But we have to work at improving ourselves.</p>
<p>In Crucial Conversations or Confrontations, the authors point out that the path many follow. Something happens, they tell themselves a story about that (&ldquo;You jerk, you are out to screw me over!&quot;), then act on it&hellip;only to find out, to their chagrin, that they&rsquo;ve got it all wrong. That the other person wasn&rsquo;t to blame or even involved.</p>
<p>I often remind others of Hanlon’s Razor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s one I have often run afoul of, so I keep it in mind when working with others.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-curiosity">Embrace Curiosity</h2>
<p>Getting ahold of yourself is about changing your reaction. The best way, as the authors suggest and I agree from my own experience, is to get curious. Get curious about what&rsquo;s happening. Do your best to engage in System II thinking that is slower and more methodical.</p>
<h2 id="asking-questions">Asking Questions</h2>
<p>Melanie Trecek-King suggests one way to challenge our beliefs (often formed at the instant we perceive a hurt or pain) about a situation. She says:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask yourself, &ldquo;What would it take to prove my belief wrong?&rdquo;</li>
<li>If your belief is falsifiable, actively look for evidence to prove yourself wrong. If the belief is true, it will withstand scrutiny. If not true, evidence will disprove it.</li>
<li>Accept the evidence.</li>
<li>Change your mind</li>
</ol>
<p>I love that last item, <em>Change Your Mind</em>. It&rsquo;s not so easy, especially when you&rsquo;ve invested your emotions into your belief.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>I like to think of it this way:</p>
<p>You have a pain. You do some web searches and discover symptoms match the pain you have. You start to look for more information that confirms your belief that suffer from that malady you self-diagnosed yourself with.</p>
<p>You start to feel horrible. By the time you get to the doctor, and they send you off for blood tests, you&rsquo;re convinced you&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>Then, the blood tests come back. You read the tests and they confirm what you knew all along&ndash;death is at your door. Then, you visit the doctor.</p>
<p>The diagnosis they have for you doesn&rsquo;t match your&rsquo;s. You let your fears tumble out (or worse, you hide them from the doctor) and you cite your internet searches.</p>
<p>The doctor confirms you have something, but it&rsquo;s not life threatening.</p>
<p>Since the news is good, you laugh in relief, then change your mind.</p>
<h2 id="look-for-evidence">Look for Evidence</h2>
<p>The same thing happens when someone ticks you off at work, in the drive through, on your way to work in the car, etc. Except, there&rsquo;s little evidence as to their mal intent except that you know they are working to hurt you.</p>
<h2 id="a-quote">A Quote</h2>
<p>In those cases, keep this quote in mind from Marcus Aurelius:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You shouldn’t give circumstances the power to rouse anger, for they don’t care at all.”
—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.38</p>

<p>Transcription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>
&ldquo;Most people will not take the trouble in finding out the truth, but are more inclined to accept the first story they hear.
<em>Source</em>: Thucydides</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong>
Often, this quote has described my own beliefs, fed to me by loving parents, well-meaning teachers, and printed in history books. The process of awakening is that of casting it all away to walk unaided into revelation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I could write a lot more about this quote. I could detail examples of the information that was erroneous, fictional, and fantastical shared with me as gospel. I could share how I passed this on to my own children in the hopes of doing for them what had been done for me, an acculturation so profound that I may as well have been protected by an invisible force field that made me feel special and treasured all my life.</p>
<p>But now, I know the truth. There was no force field. It was all a game of pretend that I learned to play better than anyone else, like a child who believes in Santa Claus through adulthood, in spite of the evidence.</p>
<h2 id="too-long-for-the-memo-pad">Too Long for the Memo Pad</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s another quote that I almost settled on today. It&rsquo;s from Isaac Asimov, but I thought, &ldquo;This is too long for my little memo pad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asimov&rsquo;s words are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in evidence. I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I&rsquo;ll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it.
The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you believe without evidence? What truths do you adhere to that, like Thucydides says, are merely the first story you heard, perhaps in your mother&rsquo;s arms, in the pew, or occupying a pupil&rsquo;s desk?</p>

<p>Over at <strong><a href="https://acreelman.blogspot.com/">The Corridor of Uncertainty</a></strong>, Alastair Creelman highlights the problem of mass personalization. For him, all this personalization comes about as a result of algorithms that offer up what we have chosen in the past. &ldquo;Today we feel used and manipulated by algorithm-driven recommendations that are now extremely commercialised. If you keep getting fed music or literature that you already like you&rsquo;ll never discover anything new,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Tonight, while exercising on the stepper, I found myself wanting to listen to a particular song. I like the song because the beat and music allow me to get lost in the moment. I usually put the song on repeat and that&rsquo;s my whole exercise routine right there for an hour and a half. But, trying to do that via Amazon Alexa, it wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to listen to one song on repeat. I had to listen to a stream. After arguing with Alexa for a few minutes, I unplugged it. I resolved to get rid of Amazon Prime services since they keep charging more and more for what once was basic functionality. Instead, I played the music on my phone, that I had saved previously.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go online, the specter of mass personalization appears. On the one hand, I like seeing books I like to read pop up. But after reading one <strong><a href="https://www.campfirewriting.com/learn/litrpg">LitRPG</a></strong>, I have read dozens because those are all that are recommended. I&rsquo;m now switching to other sources of books, including print, to escape the algorithm that keeps recommending these types of stories. When I login, I buy what I&rsquo;ve already decided is good&hellip;not what is recommended.</p>
<p>Alastair makes this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google frequently suggested my own blog posts or articles whereas I can hardly find them with Duckduckgo! I&rsquo;ve stopped using TripAdvisor since since reviews can be written by bots or trolls. I don&rsquo;t use Amazon anymore and my use of Spotify is sinking to the point where I don&rsquo;t think I want to subscribe anymore. We don&rsquo;t need to go completely offline but treat the big tech platforms with extreme care and suspicion. There are alternatives out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, I get it. It&rsquo;s time to disconnect from the commercialized algorithms that simply want to exploit us for financial gain. As my father would say, &ldquo;A fool and his money are soon parted.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve been eliminating online services, and why I&rsquo;m here at Micro blog. With one monthly fee, I get multiple services that would otherwise cost a lot more.</p>
<p>But how do you dismantle this system of personalization algorithms and still get the benefits?</p>

			 <p>I loved this quote from Shanna Peeples’ <em>Think Like Socrates</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our students need to ask questions now more than ever. To shield them from thinking and questioning in a mistaken fear of “pulling them off task” is at best wasted effort and at worst an isolation from what truly makes us human.</p>
<p>In a world increasingly uncomfortable with the changes wrought by technology, we seek out authoritarian figures to tell us what to do and how to think.</p>
<p>Questioning, therefore is good citizenship. It is the antityranny vaccine.</p>

<p>In <strong><a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2024/3/24/i-miss-snow.html">I miss snow</a></strong>, Doug Johnson laments the absence of snow, an old companion and giver of work. He writes of the nerve-wracking snow that plagued his days, longing for it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I now realize that despite its nuisance, I miss snow. . .And even a light cover of snow can give an ethereal beauty to the most common-place&hellip;I recognize the loveliness of the snow&hellip;.Sometimes it takes the absence of thing before you really appreciate it.
I miss snow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on absence, I think of all the ideas I held with passionate fervor, that kept me away from family and friends, that kept me churning ceaselessly to keep me busy. I remember the countless evenings where I rushed through dinner, driven to learn, share, and do. Now, they are gone, those things I hurried after and I can&rsquo;t help but wonder, &ldquo;Was that my snow, that thing I really appreciate now that it&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I realize, the absence of the thing. It is the quiet peace that fills the space left, like a fat man who keeps looking for the mass that isn&rsquo;t there anymore, to reassure himself, &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the quiet solitude without comfortable ideas, passions, and lies you were taught, lying over the mundane reality of your life. To see things as they are, uncovered at long last by the tapestry of thoughts not your own.</p>
<p>I miss not the snow, but the feeling of fullness, of purpose, of being an instrument of destiny. But then, a part of me is glad. I&rsquo;m only missing something that I didn&rsquo;t really need, fictions and falsehoods. The snow served a purpose, its absence a portent of climate change.</p>
<p>For me, to let go of the past, the absence of false friends&hellip;it signals change&hellip;on a winter day, is it better to have a thin blanket of lies or the truth?</p>
<h2 id="another-response">Another Response</h2>
<p>I left the following response on Doug&rsquo;s blog last night:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I miss the snow, too. Having grown up in Panama, I miss the idea of it. I miss the blizzard where evil dwells, the snow flurries that obscure my vision, the slip and slide of wheels on an uncertain path. I miss the snowplows making their way up the avenue, the snowmen gathered on the lawn. I miss the snowflakes, one and all, like a banker misses his coin.</p>
<p>But then, when sadness gathers six feet deep at my door, my tears forming crystals on my cheeks, I remember, I grew up in the summer humid heat of Panama. Snow is but a dream, where mosquitoes are unborn, iguanas wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead without a borrowed fur coat. I remember that dark rainstorms, drops so large they can kill a baby frog, renew the pools where tadpoles spawn, form the ocean waves. I see them once more, those summer days, bereft of snow, and I miss the sun of my youth.</p>
<p>Now that the chill is gone, I wonder what I will dream for tomorrow. A day without sun in another land, a grey overcast day without a blanket of snow. I wonder what I will dream of, the future or the past, or will I have a dreamless sleep, empty of expectation and sun and snow, and all that men dream when the earth wraps its arms around them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the snow go, friend, and ask instead, &ldquo;Where are your dreams gone?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bare branches reach out
Longing for winter&rsquo;s white cloak
Absence fills the air</p>

With gentle grace, the snow melts
A cruel silence sings</p>

			 <p>Although it&rsquo;s often out of our hands due to various services suffering data breaches or compromising our confidential, personally identifiable information, you can still protect yourself to some degree.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are a few of the things I do:</p>
<h2 id="banking-and-credit">Banking and Credit</h2>
<h3 id="get-alerts-via-your-bank-mobile-app-for-all-transactions-and-password-all-transactions">Get alerts via your bank mobile app for all transactions and password all transactions.</h3>
<p>I love knowing when funds come out of my bank account. Add a password or pin# to all bank account transactions. It takes an instant, but without it, it may be difficult for folks to access your accounts. And, of course, change these.</p>
<h3 id="move-away-from-debit-cards">Move away from debit cards.</h3>
<p>Switch from debit cards to protected credit cards, or use Paypal as an intermediary account. Make a decision to NOT use your debit card or write print checks with your routing and account # on them. </p>
<h3 id="freeze-your-credit-reports-to-prevent-new-accounts"><strong>Freeze your credit reports to prevent new accounts.</strong> </h3>
<p>It prevents others from opening new accounts in my name unless they have my special PIN#. These approaches aren&rsquo;t foolproof but they do help. Credit Freeze sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.freeze.equifax.com/Freeze/jsp/SFF_PersonalIDInfo.jsp">Equifax Credit Freeze Site</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze">TransUnion</a> ($10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html">Experian</a> ($10)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="online-social-security-account">Online Social Security account.</h3>
<p>Create the account before the bad guys do. Problem is, if you froze your credit reports, you&rsquo;ll have to go in person to the Social Security Admin building.</p>
<h3 id="file-tax-return-early">File tax return early.</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do it, they will. If sending confidential documents via email, use a service like BitWarden Send.</p>
<h3 id="check-your-credit-frequentlyhttpswwwconsumerftcgovarticles0155-free-credit-reports"><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports">Check your credit frequently.**</a></h3>
<p>One way to do that is to use <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/"><strong>Annual Credit Reports</strong></a>. It provides a free service, but you may need to pay to get that more often.</p>
<h3 id="sign-up-for-identity-theft-alerthttpswwwalertsequifaxcomautofraud_onlinejspfraudalertjsp"><a href="https://www.alerts.equifax.com/AutoFraud_Online/jsp/fraudAlert.jsp"><strong>Sign up for Identity Theft Alert</strong></a></h3>
<p>Fill out this form to notify the credit agencies of potential identity theft.</p>
<h2 id="file-and-folder-encryption-on-usb-external-drives">File and Folder Encryption on USB External Drives</h2>
<p>Everyone I know relies on USB external drives, as well as cloud storage. For cloud storage, only store documents that you are collaborating with others about and do not reveal sensitive data. For other documents, encrypt your data at rest on your computer/device hard drive or when it&rsquo;s stored on USB external drives. You can also encrypt data and put it in the cloud, if that&rsquo;s what you want to do.</p>
<p>I also recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup an encrypted email (e.g. ProtonMail) for financial accounts</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2456400,00.asp"><strong>Setup 2-factor authentication</strong></a> using an Authenticator app for all email, cloud storage, digital accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use secure passwords</strong>. I like to use <a href="https://www.packetizer.com/security/pwgen/">secure password generator</a> then add my own twist to it. I end up with a secure password that I keep track of using a password manager (e.g. <a href="https://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/"><strong>BitWarden</strong></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get more than one form of ID, such as passport, passport card, and driver&rsquo;s license.</strong> You never know when you will have to prove you are who you say you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encrypt confidential data documents</strong> you have saved in cloud storage (e.g. Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox), as well as when they are &ldquo;at rest&rdquo; on your laptop or USB external drives. Some free tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html"><strong>7z</strong></a> with <a href="https://itstillworks.com/strong-7zip-encryption-2212.html"><strong>AES-256</strong></a> encryption (on Mac? Use <a href="https://www.keka.io/en/"><strong>Keka</strong></a>)</p>

			 <p>Over the last few YEARS, I&rsquo;ve kept <strong><a href="https://readdle.com/documents">Readdle Documents</a></strong> app on my iOS phone. It&rsquo;s been a handy app to have and I started using it when it was free. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve switched to a subscription model that is $9.99 a month with recurring billing.</p>
<p>While a part of me feels bad about using their app for years at no cost, paying $9.99 a month with recurring billing is not something I want to do. After all, there are only so many cups of coffee one can give up (and hey, I don&rsquo;t drink Starbucks) or other stuff to cover the expenses.</p>
<p>Documents is gone now. Farewell, old friend.</p>
<p>Alas, I know I&rsquo;m old-fashioned. I want to pay once for an app, and it stays bought. It&rsquo;s totally unreasonable I know, but I had no problem paying for <strong><a href="https://www.skyjos.com/fileexplorer/">$4.99 one-time fee for an app</a></strong> that I won&rsquo;t have to renew. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll try to find a way to eliminate the need for that kind of app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>FE File Explorer has turned out to me MUCH easier to use and navigate than Readdle&rsquo;s Documents app. One of the main reasons I kept Documents around, aside from its ability to view ePubs (ebooks) and play audio/video, was the ease of transferring files. Documents relied on DocsTransfer.com website, rather than arcane FTP/HTTP links that you could use. However, switching back to FTP/HTTP links was easy&hellip;it eliminated having to connect the two devices, except via a web browser.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise, though, was migrating gigabytes of data from Documents to FE File Explorer. Instead of uploading it to my computer, as I feared I would need to do, I was able to simply SHARE entire folders from one app to the other. Transfer was instantaneous, and in a matter of 2-3 minutes, I was done. After verifying files transferred successfully, I was able to remove the Readdle Documents app from my device.</p>

<p>Anyone who watched a teacher work through the pandemic, facilitating remote learning, knows how important <strong><a href="https://www.visiblelearningmetax.com/influences/view/teacher-student_relationships">teacher-student relationships</a></strong> are. There are people out there, though, who think kids are being indoctrinated at school. Unfortunately, some see SEL as a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What’s clear is that there is a segment of the public that has conflated the SEL goal of ‘working well with others’ to mean something other than supporting a student’s learning,” even though SEL programs are not focused on diversity and equity, said Tammy Hughes, PhD, a professor of school psychology at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and past president of APA’s Division 16 (School Psychology).</p>

			 <p>Bummer. Daniel Kahneman died. He was the author of <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>. You can <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman-del-h-khan-mds-spp-psc/">read an overview here</a></strong>. In a New York Times article about Kahneman, Steven Pinker said of Daniel’s  work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…human reason left to its own devices is apt to engage in a number of fallacies and systematic errors, so if we want to make better decisions in our personal lives and as a society, we ought to be aware of these biases and seek workarounds.
That’s a powerful and important discovery.” ( <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/business/daniel-kahneman-dead.html">source</a></strong> )</p>

<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve mentioned Kahneman&rsquo;s work and it&rsquo;s been a great way to understand how human brains work.

			 <p>In every town, there&rsquo;s a street with a sign board with a huge hand. The hand beckons passersby, hoping to attract their attention. The hope of a response that provides direction draws people in. The desire to get certain information about an uncertain future is a powerful pull for some folks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="my-faith-shielded-me">My Faith Shielded Me</h4>
<p>Going to university for my &ldquo;freshman/sophmore&rdquo; year in Wichita Falls, Texas, I remember a certain street that had a palmistry sign up in front of a decrepit building painted white, edged with decay. My roommate at the time, a Born Again fundamentalist Christian, would rave about psychics, recalling Scripture denouncing psychics and witches.</p>
<p>As a Catholic at 17 years of age, well-aware of exorcism lore, I wasn&rsquo;t interested in what a psychic had to say. It wasn&rsquo;t because I had engaged my critical thinking faculties to shield me, but rather, my unwillingness to open the door to evil spirits. I remember thinking, at that time, that evil has no hold on those who don&rsquo;t believe in its power, it&rsquo;s impotency in the face of the Spirit. At seventeen, I was well-indoctrinated. Brainwashed. Unfortunately, so was one of my friends, whom I met later down the road as an 18 year old.</p>
<h4 id="a-church-on-every-corner-a-psychic-network">A Church on Every Corner, A Psychic Network</h4>
<p>A year later, while at home from college, I remember one of my fellow theatre ushers (free movies in a time before Netflix, wouldn&rsquo;t you know, were great then) who found himself obsessed with psychics. He graduated from psychics to television pastors, asking me if I would ever send money to them to gain their benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way, Mike, all they want is your money&rdquo; I said.  Just this past weekend, I had occasion to think of the conversation as I drove past four mega-churches on the highway. And, psychics and palm readers abound&hellip;everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they connected?&rdquo; I wondered. Does our penchant for spirituality prepare the mind for psychics, crystal vendors, and horoscope prognosticators?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>
The psychic services industry in the United States generates approximately $2.3 <strong><a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/psychic-services-industry/">billion</a></strong>, employs over <strong><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/psychic-industry-fortune-tellers-ibisworld-221118482.html">85,000 people who make $1.5 billion</a></strong> in total wages a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I never did send my money to television pastors&hellip;for the same reason I&rsquo;d never invest in a psychic or palmistry. These are both matters of fantasy and fiction. Not only that, but there was some strong scripture in Deuteronomy that I couldn&rsquo;t ignore at that age. Today, I remain amazed at how well these fictions grip the mind.</p>
<p>We should all know better than boys swayed by a bit of artistry and pseudoscience and (fake) magic.</p>
<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>The problem, as you might imagine, is that psychics offer to reveal a fundamental truth about our future to our present self. The sources of insight often lie in the nether region of the unknown, the place of demons and witches, of spirits and things that go bump during a seance. None of these are backed by <strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/empirical-evidence">empirical evidence</a></strong>, and they may mislead people like my fellow theatre usher. While love is a mystery at 18 years of age, and whether it lies in ones future, there are other areas that may lead away from what has been learned over time.</p>
<h3 id="amplify">Amplify</h3>
<p>Lacking a critical thinking process, reliance on psychics and pseudoscience results in problems well beyond who we are as individuals. They can impact our families, society, and leave everyone with a sense of, &ldquo;Who can I trust? What can I trust?&rdquo; I suspect that is what opens us all up to foolishness. Consider the logic of a believer when engaging with psychics. Psychics and the insights from a psychic are poisoned fruit, as well as forbidden. They are prognostications, that while true or subtle lies, lead to our ultimate downfall as believers. There becomes a whole other world of spirit, good and bad, vying for our attention and interests. All without a shred of evidence except belief.</p>

<h4 id="the-xyz-made-me-do-it">The XYZ Made Me Do It</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to blame someone else for our own actions, or lack of action. I&rsquo;m reminded of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Kalamazoo_shootings">Kalamazoo Uber driver who saw a demon in his app</a></strong>, which compelled him to murder. While the consequences may be less dramatic, it&rsquo;s easy to see the issues that arise when you believe something with origins outside empirical science are moving you. From personal consequences (e.g. spending money on psychics, fake drugs to not proven to do anything but sold via anecdote or someone you trust) to society (e.g. climate change), it can get pretty dire.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="storysolution">Story/Solution</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Please, oh my God, what&rsquo;s happening to me?&rdquo; said my friend as he staggered into my house. My wife (newly married) came over to see what was happening. As my friend babbled an incoherent account of how he was being persecuted by evil spirits, I realized that his mind had finally snapped. His desire, like that of many others, was to find purpose in life, to be important, to find love. And, all those desires, those needs, had not been met.</p>
<p>Once he had calmed down, I checked with a trained mental health professional (the husband of one of my older friends from electronic bulletin board services (BBSs)), and he made some specific suggestions, which I followed. Unfortunately, my friend decided to not take advantage of those, and I ended up escorting him to my door. I never saw him again. Since I moved shortly afterwards, starting a new life with my wife, I don&rsquo;t know what happened to him.</p>
<p>Now, looking back, I realize that if someone had shared with him early on a critical thinking toolkit, enhanced his scientific literacy, enabled him to distinguish between claims with empirical support, and those without, he would have been able to withstand the insecurities of growing up as a young person. To the degree I was a skeptical thinker, trained in the Catholic tradition at the time, I was able to avoid the roadblocks to happiness he sought out and wallowed in, miserable and despairing. But I had access to many texts&hellip;and some of my father&rsquo;s practical nature sank in.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more I realize what a disservice we do to young people when we bathe them in the fakery, giving power to psychics by crediting the evil of the power from whence psychics obtain their insights. All of it done to aggrandize the power of the &ldquo;good.&rdquo; How my friend&rsquo;s story ended, I don&rsquo;t know. I can only hope that somehow, he found a way through the mystical maze of torture he found himself in.</p>
<h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>
<p>By embracing a more scientifically informed point of view, he could have focused himself on gathering information, transforming it into knowledge, and then making decisions based on scientific consensus. While not perfect, it&rsquo;s much better to be an empowered skeptic rather than a pseudoscientist peddling falsehood and lies, even when benevolent.  And, when encountering a question for which there is no answer, accepting that this is an area one knows nothing about. Then, begins the process of formulating a hypothesis, gathering evidence, inviting others to test your findings, and so on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="offer">Offer</h3>
<p>Imagine what would happen if, in schools and churches, we prioritized skeptical thinking, demystifying the scientific process, encouraging scientific literacy. If our children learned media literacy, critical thinking, and built on that natural curiosity all humans enjoy when young.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I know this?</li>
<li>How do you know this?</li>
<li>What evidence is there?</li>
<li>Is the explanation that you have constructed about this evidence accurate?</li>
<li>What are some ways I can question what I hold true?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Every organization needs to offer evidence-based reasoning approaches for their respective fields of study or endeavor. In this way, all of us are able to put aside our dependence on beliefs in fantastical creatures who seek to trick us with partial truths offered via a psychic or reading of palms, tea leaves, and/or entrails.</p>
<h3 id="response">Response</h3>
<p>The response I wish I had had when a young man was to be better equipped to seek out reliable sources of information, helping others to engage more critically. At the time, I relied on my Catholic upbringing about the evil of psychic sources to dissuade myself and others, when possible, of seeking out palm readers and psychics.</p>
<p>Now, I see that if I had been better prepared, I could have relied on critical thinking, questioning the validity of these preternatural claims. I know that many still fight principalities and powers, engaging in a spiritual battle in their minds that has no basis in empirical evidence or science.</p>
<p>Today, I wonder what my life would have been like WITHOUT spiritualism. What would it have been like with the benefit of critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning? It&rsquo;s then that I wonder, what would a nation of skeptical thinkers be able to accomplish?</p>
<h4 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h4>
<p>I really enjoyed this page&rsquo;s introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of us are not what we could be. We are less. We have great capacity. But most of it is dormant; most is undeveloped. Improvement in thinking is like improvement in basketball, in ballet, or in playing the saxophone. It is unlikely to take place in the absence of a conscious commitment to learn.</p>
<p>As long as we take our thinking for granted, we don’t do the work required for improvement.</p>
<p>Development in thinking requires a gradual process requiring plateaus of learning and just plain hard work. It is not possible to become an excellent thinker simply because one wills it. Changing one’s habits of thought is a long-range project, happening over years, not weeks or months. The essential traits of a critical thinker require an extended period of development.</p>
<p>How, then, can we develop as critical thinkers? How can we help ourselves and our students to practice better thinking in everyday life? <strong><a href="https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-in-everyday-life-9-strategies/512">source: Critical Thinking in Everyday Life: 9 Strategies</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine that becoming a critical thinker IS hard work, and it should be taught in schools&hellip;not left up to circumstance, privilege, and self-discovery.</p>

<h2 id="attention-fight-falsehood">Attention: Fight Falsehood</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that, today, with so much access to information, it would be easier to tell truth from lie. You&rsquo;d think that truth sparkles like a gem, while lies gather like stacks of coal. But these days, lies sparkle more than truth. Pseudoscience, false claims, are also designed to fool people. One tool to fight falsehood is the concept of scientific consensus.</p>
<h2 id="interest-what-is-scientific-consensus">Interest: What Is Scientific Consensus?</h2>
<p>When I think of what consensus is, it seems like it&rsquo;s about people agreeing and compromising. But that&rsquo;s not <em>scientific</em> consensus. Scientific consensus makes sense as a preponderance of evidence resulting from research, experiments, and peer review&hellip;and, all the experts who study the science of a topic are convinced by that evidence that something is true. Scientific consensus doesn&rsquo;t mean that facts are written in stone, never-changing. But it does mean that what is agreed on IS backed up by evidence, can change in the face of new evidence. So, while there is no 100% surety, it&rsquo;s the best evidence of what we know agreed upon by experts.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="desire-the-strength-of-agreement">Desire: The Strength of Agreement</h2>
<p>When I accept the evidence in alignment with scientific consensus, I am joining real experts in the field. As such, false claims that aren&rsquo;t backed up by real scientific evidence can be disregarded. The strength of that agreement is comforting in a way that fake beliefs can&rsquo;t challenge or measure up to.</p>
<h2 id="action-stand-with-science">Action: Stand with Science</h2>
<p>As you watch television, and that commercial for XYZ drug comes on, make sure you use scientific consensus to separate fact from fiction, truth from lie. Before you click or tap the share button on Facebook for an amazing story, take a moment to find out what the scientific consensus is. At first, you may feel disappointment that yet another claim is false. In time, though, you will come to a different perspective that aligns what you choose to agree with with the scientific consensus.</p>

<p>Of course, <strong><a href="https://pantagraph.com/opinion/column/flick-a-tv-star-at-the-bloomington-courthouse/article_3172c202-c23f-11ee-8a0e-5f53b8160c5e.html">Greg Faley</a></strong> IS a real person. He&rsquo;s starring in a commercial for Prevagen. Seeing these anecdotes supporting Prevagen is irritating. They pop up as one of the many commercials while I&rsquo;m watching television, and they tick me off. At the very least, these are paid statements on behalf of a scientifically unproven drug that is geared to appeal to the fears of older people. And, that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<h2 id="anecdotes-as-evidence">Anecdotes as Evidence</h2>
<p>Melanie Trecek-King (<strong><a href="https://thinkingispower.com">Thinking Is Power</a>)</strong> points out we have to be on guard against anecdotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anecdotes are personal experiences that are used as evidence for a claim. Our brains jump to conclusions and assume the experience is a good indicator of what’s typical and even that events are due to causation. Vivid and emotional stories are often particularly convincing and memorable.</p>
<p>Many people think that anecdotes are a sure-fire way of knowing what’s true. Indeed, it can be quite difficult to convince someone that they might be wrong.
But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anecdotes are infamously unreliable<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (<strong><a href="https://flux.community/melanie-trecek-king/2021/08/when-evaluating-anecdotes-remember-you-are-easiest-person-fool/">source</a>)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She suggests there are four reasons for that, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can&rsquo;t trust our own experience</li>
<li>Anecdotes aren&rsquo;t controlled</li>
<li>Anecdotes aren&rsquo;t typical, varying from person to person. As Trecek-King puts it, &ldquo;using single observations can mislead us into thinking something is typical when it’s not. For that, we need statistical evidence.&rdquo;</li>
<li>People lie</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t trust experience and anecdotes, what can you trust? Melanie Trecek-King suggests statistics. She suggests that when you try to find out what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not via Google, try to find the scientific consensus. With access to AI tools like Perplexity, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to get at what the scientific consensus is.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-scientific-consensus">What&rsquo;s the Scientific Consensus?</h2>
<p>Every time I see Prevagen commercial on television, I&rsquo;m intrigued. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be neat to have a drug that could magically restore my memory? No longer would I reach for a word and have it just out of grasp. However, the scientific consensus reveals this miracle memory restorer leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a description of what scientific consensus is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“scientific consensus” needs to be based on evidence and converging lines of existing evidence are a prerequisite, distinguishing a knowledge-based scientific consensus from a simple agreement. To quote John Reisman, “Science is not a democracy. It is a dictatorship. It is evidence that does the dictating.” Because of that, a few disagreeing contrarians on the fringe don’t really matter unless and until they can show evidence of comparable weight which explains the existing data and observations better. The weight of evidence is what matters <strong>(<a href="https://skepticalscience.com/explainer-scientific-consensus.shtml">source</a>)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-scientific-consensus-on-prevagen">The Scientific Consensus on Prevagen</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the scientific consensus on Prevagen is that there is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->insufficient evidence to support its claims of improving memory or cognitive function<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Consumers and healthcare professionals are advised to approach Prevagen with caution and to prioritize evidence-based interventions for cognitive health.
The scientific consensus on Prevagen, a dietary supplement marketed to help with mild memory loss associated with aging, is largely skeptical due to limited and questionable evidence supporting its efficacy and safety. Prevagen contains apoaequorin, a protein originally found in certain types of jellyfish, and is promoted as supporting brain health and memory improvement.</p>
<p>However, several key points emerge from the analysis of available information:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited and Questionable Efficacy</strong>: The evidence supporting Prevagen&rsquo;s claims is not robust. A clinical study cited by the manufacturer has significant limitations, casting doubt on the merits of the evidence presented. The study&rsquo;s results are not convincingly supportive of Prevagen&rsquo;s effectiveness in improving memory or cognitive functions[2].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concerns Over Bioavailability and Safety</strong>: Experts have raised concerns about whether apoaequorin can be effectively absorbed by the human body and whether it can cross the blood-brain barrier to exert any potential effects on brain function. Additionally, there have been reports of adverse events, including seizures, strokes, heart arrhythmias, chest pain, and dizziness, associated with Prevagen&rsquo;s use, although these reports alone do not prove causation[5].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory and Legal Challenges</strong>: Prevagen has faced scrutiny from regulatory bodies and has been involved in legal battles over its marketing practices. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and New York State Attorney General charged Quincy Bioscience, the maker of Prevagen, with fraud, alleging false advertising and unsubstantiated claims about the product&rsquo;s efficacy. Despite these challenges, Prevagen remains on the market as a dietary supplement, which is subject to less stringent regulatory oversight than pharmaceuticals[3][7].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skepticism from the Medical and Scientific Community</strong>: The medical and scientific community remains skeptical of Prevagen&rsquo;s claims, largely due to the lack of compelling, peer-reviewed scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The FDA has curbed unfounded memory supplement claims, emphasizing the need for evidence-based validation of such products[1]. Furthermore, pharmacists' recommendations of Prevagen, as indicated by surveys, are likely influenced more by the product&rsquo;s extensive advertising rather than solid clinical evidence of its efficacy[2][4].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the scientific consensus on Prevagen is that there is insufficient evidence to support its claims of improving memory or cognitive function. Consumers and healthcare professionals are advised to approach Prevagen with caution and to prioritize evidence-based interventions for cognitive health.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week, I had a chance to revisit my thoughts on educational technology in the classroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to get back to pen and paper,&rdquo; said a colleague today. The statement was a reflection of some of the conversations going on at the State level. A part of me cringed a bit to hear that, since it suggests educational technology is something folks are backing away from as a cost-effective solution in schools.</p>
<h2 id="cost-effective">Cost Effective?</h2>
<p>Then, I realized, educational technology has seldom been the cost-effective solution. Instead, it&rsquo;s been the solution most people reach for when they want to seem&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>innovative (change that adds value)</li>
<li>engaging (for student learners)</li>
<li>exciting</li>
<li>fun and thrilling</li>
<li>like they are preparing children for a future of unknown possibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of innovations that work in schools. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to rethink being innovative and make a beeline back to what works?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-only-a-quarter-of-federally-funded-education-innovations-benefited-students-report-says/">A February 2024 report about a research-and-development program inside the Department of Education</a></strong> &hellip;shows <em>many interventions made no difference</em>_</p>
<p>The failure rate was 74 percent. Under this program, called Investing in Innovation or i3, the federal government gave out $1.4 billion between 2010 and 2016 to education nonprofits and researchers for the purpose of developing and testing new ideas in the classroom.</p>
<p>&hellip;<strong>only 26 percent of the innovations yielded any positive benefits for students</strong> and no negative harms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is, technology is a flash in the pan innovation because it&rsquo;s always changing. What&rsquo;s innovative today isn&rsquo;t tomorrow. It simply becomes part of the woodwork. Or it disappears. Consider <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_software">Microsoft Zune</a></strong> vs the iPod. It doesn&rsquo;t matter now, right? The Zune was a failure at launch, while the iPod was an amazing success. But both are now obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-you-learn">What Did You Learn?</h2>
<p>Yet, we learned something from them. And, schools that rushed to bring iPods into schools so kids could create and listen to podcasts, well, someone said to me, &ldquo;Podcasts aren&rsquo;t that exciting anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="podcast-excitement">Podcast Excitement</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, even if there are 3.2 million podcasts as of February, 2024 with <strong><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/podcast-listeners">504.9 million podcast listeners worldwide</a></strong> (<strong><a href="https://www.yaguara.co/podcast-statistics/">25.3%</a></strong> of all internet users). Include inactive podcasts, the number jumps to 4.1 million <strong><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-podcasts">source</a></strong>. Podcasting industry is expected to grow and is valued at <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/how-many-people-listen-to-podcasts"><strong>$94.9 billion dollars by 2028</strong></a>.</p>
<p>But no one needs to know how to make them in the classroom anymore&hellip;right? That may be because podcasts aren&rsquo;t essential to the work of schools.</p>
<p>When deploying any edtech solution, the question always boils down to some variant of, &ldquo;How did it accelerate student learning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to gauge for students in classrooms with edtech. The real issue isn&rsquo;t the edtech, it&rsquo;s what it should be accomplishing, the reason why it was brought in as an accelerator.</p>
<h2 id="technology-accelerator">Technology Accelerator</h2>
<p>Does technology accelerate student learning? The evidence is in. The answer is, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; It kills me to type that.</p>
<p>The grand experiment (edtech in classrooms) is over. The score is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper and Pencil - 1</li>
<li>EdTech - 0</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, pencil/paper is where the magic happens when it comes to long-term information retention. Edtech is not required, just nice to have for students. It&rsquo;s essential for teachers, though. We have to stop thinking of schools as Technical Training vehicles (&ldquo;kids need to know how to use the tech of the future&rdquo;) and focus on nuts and bolts of learning (e.g. Visible Learning Meta X strategies that accelerate actually learning).</p>
<h2 id="scientific-consensus-anyone">Scientific Consensus, anyone?</h2>
<p>Wait, you don&rsquo;t agree? Mind you, I&rsquo;m not saying technology is worthless. I&rsquo;m not saying that it shouldn&rsquo;t be available in schools. But now that we know it&rsquo;s place, a supplemental tool that changes everything except how students learn and retain information over the long-term, it&rsquo;s time to rethink how money is spent.</p>
<h3 id="for-younger-students">For Younger Students</h3>
<p>In the final analysis, it shouldn&rsquo;t be used in younger grades, and use in middle/high school is problematic. You could ban it altogether and students scores would go up.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the scientific consensus suggests that educational technology can have a positive impact on student achievement, but its effectiveness is not guaranteed and depends on a range of factors including the quality of implementation, the educational context, and the support provided to teachers and students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, this was a show-stopper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High levels of technology use in the classroom tend to correlate with lower student performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One recent study found that over a third of all technology purchases made by middle schools simply weren’t used. And only 5 percent of purchases met their purchaser’s usage goals. (source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put simply, ensuring that every child attains a baseline level of proficiency in reading and mathematics seems to do more to create equal opportunities in a digital world than can be achieved by expanding or subsidizing access to high-tech devices and services&hellip;students who use computers very frequently at school do a lot worse in most learning outcomes, even after accounting for social background and student demographics.
Source: OECD Publishing - Students, Computers and Learning Making the Connection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that said, there&rsquo;s a lot of money and effort put into addressing the range of factors that impact POSITIVE use of edtech in classrooms.</p>
<h2 id="rush-to-save">Rush to Save</h2>
<p>A lot of folks are asking, &ldquo;Why bother when less expensive methods get the job done?&rdquo; And given how deeply embedded tech is people&rsquo;s lives, it&rsquo;s natural to ask,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Why put this (use tech to accelerate learning) when its only minimally effective?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Use tech (including AI) for productivity, reference (online data gathering, &ldquo;researching&rdquo;), collaboration, but not to improve student achievement and/or scores.</p>
<p>For that you need teaching using evidence-based strategies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-changing-perspective">A Changing Perspective</h2>
<p>My perspective has changed, mostly as a result of increased awareness of high-effect size instructional strategies. Many of those prove effective when used (many educators aren&rsquo;t aware of their usage, but that&rsquo;s my experience and anecdotal) and don&rsquo;t require technology at all except as an supplemental resource (e.g. digital texts, videos, images available on search).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now before you get after me about John Hattie&rsquo;s work on high-effect size instructional strategies, let&rsquo;s keep in mind that Mike Bell&rsquo;s work in <em>The Fundamentals of Teaching</em> as well as many other folks, like <em>What Works Clearinghouse</em>, Robert Marzano, and other spaces offer solid evidence on what works in schools. And, patterns emerge in the data as to what works, and what is less effective.</p>
<p>One insight? Edtech seldom (if at all) ranks high on those lists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that insight was an opinion back in the day, but now, we have the meats, er, evidence. Yes, the evidence. And anyone with an AI can put it together.</p>
<p>Today, I bet every superintendent out there is asking AI,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What can I cut from my budget with minimal impact to student achievement?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With under-utilization of edtech in schools, it&rsquo;s a prime target for downsizing, especially when usage detracts from student achievement and there is evidence technology doesn&rsquo;t get used as much.</p>
<p>One supposes that professional learning on high-effect sized instructional strategies AND educational technology would be a priority. Most people only get the message on training about instructional strategies that work, and forget about the technology. But that&rsquo;s like planning a formal dinner but using those wimpy paper plates with forks that break to serve it.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-low-cost-methods">Alternative, Low-Cost Methods</h2>
<p>You can implement alternative methods to edtech (e.g. PBL, cooperative learning, formative assessment, hands-on experiments, experiential learning) without heavy-duty technology investment. Having easy access to edtech makes a difference&hellip;but not directly to student achievement.</p>
<p>For fun, I asked AI to come up with this chart comparing traditional paper-and-pencil methods with the educational technology strategies and assign an estimated cost.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Is moderate to high cost of edtech worth the investment when there&rsquo;s none to little professional development to go with it for teachers and students? The answer is obvious today. What would you keep? What would you stop doing?</p>

			 <p>What a fascinating perspective and from Aldous Huxley. I don&rsquo;t recall learning about this while reading his book. How funny we learn what made them famous but not what impelled them to greatness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is man&rsquo;s intelligence that makes him so often behave more stupidly than the beasts. Man is impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic. Thus, no animal is clever enough, when there is a drought, to imagine that the rain is being withheld by evil spirits, or as punishment for its transgressions. Therefore you never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion.</p>
<p>No horse, for example would kill one of its foals to make the wind change direction. Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies.</p>
<p>Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat&rsquo;s meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, intelligent enough. ~Aldous Huxley</p>

<p>How fast does it take people to get addicted to AI? How many minutes does it take to get addicted? Microsoft reports that all it takes is eleven minutes a day for 11 weeks (11 x 11 is the AI tipping point). They describe it in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A time savings of just 11 minutes a day was the magic number where users started to see value from AI.</p>
<p>To be clear, most people actually saved more time each day: the most efficient users saved 30 minutes a day, the equivalent of 10 hours a month, while the average person saved 14 minutes a day, or nearly five hours each month. But according to our research, 11 minutes of time savings is all it takes for most people to feel like AI is useful—the key to getting a habit to stick.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, 11 is an important number. We also found that 11 weeks is the breakthrough moment&hellip;.
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/ai-data-drop-the-11-by-11-tipping-point/">source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-addiction">The Problem with Addiction</h2>
<p>Although drug addiction is different from AI addiction, since it&rsquo;s hard to gauge when the former will move into addiction, there may be some similarities. Consider the vulnerable ages for drug addiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies have shown adults develop habits that lead to addiction early in life — particularly during adolescence. This is a time when many teenagers are first exposed to drugs and alcohol. The brain is still developing during these ages. The parts that control impulsivity, decision-making and executive control are not yet mature; therefore, exposure to illicit substances could stunt development, heightening the likelihood of obtaining a drug or alcohol disorder. <strong><a href="https://www.drugrehab.com/addiction/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop/">source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that exposing teenagers older than 13 or 18 will get them hooked to AI? It&rsquo;s a stretch, right, but it&rsquo;s too early to know. What parallels could be drawn between AI addiction and some other type, say, social media?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="social-media-addiction">Social Media Addiction</h2>
<p>Most of us use social media every day, without ill effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>social media usage is a habit for most of us. There’s no harm in our habits if they don’t harm ourselves or others. In reality, few of us are addicted to social media. <strong><a href="https://www.leehealth.org/health-and-wellness/healthy-news-blog/mental-health/are-you-addicted-to-social-media">source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article cited above does suggest six questions to ascertain if you are at risk of developing an addiction to social media. What if those questions were re-written for AI?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="gauging-ai-addiction---seven-questions-to-ask">Gauging AI Addiction - Seven Questions to Ask</h2>
<p>The following questions have been adapted and added to aside from the original six available from the Addiction Center. That said, the questions below have no basis in fact or evidence of any kind. They are a thought experiment of sorts. Ok, with that disclaimer in mind, here are the revised questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you spend a lot of time thinking about interacting with AI models or chatbots or planning to use them?</li>
<li>Do you feel urges to engage with AI models or chatbots more and more?</li>
<li>Do you use AI models or chatbots to forget about personal problems?</li>
<li>Have you often tried to reduce the time spent on AI models or chatbots without success?</li>
<li>Do you become restless or troubled if unable to interact with AI models or chatbots?</li>
<li>Has your interaction with AI models or chatbots been so frequent that it has had a negative impact on your job or studies?</li>
<li>Do you rely on AI models or chatbots for companionship or emotional support to the extent that it affects your real-life relationships?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find that you are at-risk for AI Addiction, consider these detox strategies.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="ai-detox-strategies">AI Detox Strategies</h2>
<p>Here are a few detox strategies to enable you to flush AI out of your system, to reconfigure your brain to stop being so dependent on AI all the time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Track Your AI Habits</strong>: Use apps to monitor how much time you spend with AI and chatbots, and get insights into when and how to cut back. Set boundaries and establish AI usage goals (e.g. work only or use it instead of Google or Bing search).</li>
<li><strong>Create a Custom Detox Plan</strong>: Analyze your AI usage patterns. Set up detox schedule that fits your daily routine. Make sure to decide on certain times or activities when you won&rsquo;t use AI. Limit your interactions to specific purposes, not just using AI for everything.</li>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a 3-2-1 on book bans in libraries, which <strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/14/1238678902/book-bans-libraries-american-library-association-schools#:~:text=Library%20book%20challenges%20soared%20in%202023%2C%20ALA%20report%20finds%20Overall,ever%20recorded%20by%20the%20ALA.">National Public Radio (NPR) reported</a></strong> as increasing in 2023.</p>

<p>The American Library Association reported that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of titles targeted for censorship surged 65 percent in 2023 compared to 2022, reaching the highest levels ever documented by the American Library Association (ALA). The new numbers released today show efforts to censor 4,240 unique book titles* in schools and libraries. This tops the previous high from 2022, when 2,571 unique titles were targeted for censorship. ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom documented 1,247 demands to censor library books, materials, and resources in 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an educator, a book reader from early on, I strongly believe human beings of any age should be allowed to read whatever the heck they want. Reading is an education, a way of gaining experiences beyond the scope of what your current situation allows. Everything I&rsquo;ve ever read has helped me in some way, even the stuff I read and said, &ldquo;Yuck, no thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a 3-2-1 via <strong><a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">Perplexity.ai</a></strong> that certainly made me think a little more deeply about this situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the face of escalating book challenges, libraries stand as bastions of intellectual freedom, reminding us that access to diverse ideas is the cornerstone of a free society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These attacks on our freedom to read should trouble every person who values liberty and our constitutional rights.

<p>Allow me to share an excerpt from Amanda Gorman&rsquo;s poem, <em>The Hill We Climb</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it.
Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.
This effort very nearly succeeded.
But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.
In this truth, in this faith, we trust,
for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.
This is the era of just redemption.

			 <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I was a few days ago old when I discovered my smart health tracker also keeps tabs on my location and movements, available to the police. Well, at least I think that it does based on my viewing of the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNwoNfApe8">latest CSI: Las Vegas (cue music)</a></strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Everyone I know is wearing an AI-powered health tracker. This includes wearable devices like Fitbit (recently acquired by Google to much complaint). Where is my sensitive health data going? What I eat, how much I move, whether I got my Flu/COVID shot or not, etc. is all being aggregated by Big Tech (e.g. Apple, Google) in partnership with Big Insurance (e.g. Humana&rsquo;s Go 365). How do you strike a balance between getting the benefits of AI health tracking and ensuring my personal data stays secure, private?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced a slew of initiatives to deploy its artificial intelligence models in the health care industry, including a tool that will help Fitbit users glean insights from their wearable devices and a partnership to improve screenings for cancer and disease in India.
<strong><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/google-deepens-ai-push-into-health-care-with-fitbit-screenings-1.2048856">via Bloomberg</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="amplify">Amplify</h2>
<p>Some of the consequences of AI-powered health tracking without privacy protections in place? Hmm&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Health data could be misused for commercial gain</li>
<li>Personal health information is stolen or used for potential discrimination (like insurance company dropping you because you ate too many donuts tracked by your visit to the donut shop and then how many times your hand lifted to your mouth with a donut in it&hellip;who knows what AI can do?)</li>
<li>Lack of privacy protections might kick off an anti-health technology wave because you and I don&rsquo;t trust them anymore</li>
</ul>
<p>What other consequences might result?</p>
<h2 id="storysolution">Story/Solution</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s recent announcement about integrating Gemini (it&rsquo;s AI model) into Fitbit devices sends a shudder up my arm. What &ldquo;personalized health insights&rdquo; they provide won&rsquo;t be as useful as you might hope. The private, confidential health data their AI consumes to tell me, &ldquo;Stopping at the donut shop once a day&rdquo; will be worth far more than the benefit.</p>
<p>Still, AI feature&rsquo;s like this could coach folks like me after analyzing my health data. This is an embryonic first step for AI, so to speak, and who knows what new, action steps I could take with an AI&rsquo;s insight.</p>
<h2 id="transformation">Transformation</h2>
<p>Maybe, the insertion of AI-powered Fitbit devices that ALSO have built-in protections for privacy would be helpful. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to get solid coaching on health AND know that I can trust my data will be secure. What&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s motto again? Oh&hellip;nevermind.</p>
<h2 id="offer">Offer</h2>
<p>What Big Tech needs to offer is more robust security features, and ironclad agreements to safeguard information. Maybe tools like data encryption and anonymization will work.</p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>What do you think about AI-powered health trackers? Is this something you are worried about or curious about? Write a response via Mastodon, email (see link below), or blog it and then let me know what you think via social media. What&rsquo;s been your experience in this arena? After all, it won&rsquo;t be long before AI is asking, &ldquo;Who are you?</p>

<p>Smart home devices get compromised every day. Whether it&rsquo;s your security camera to a baby monitor, your privacy is increasingly at-risk.</p>
<h2 id="interest">Interest</h2>
<p>An estimated 672 million households are expected to use smart home devices by 2027. What can anyone do about cybersecurity challenges those households will face? Are you sure you want to let these devices into your home without them being properly vetted and tested?</p>
<h2 id="desire">Desire</h2>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be amazing to have devices that are secure and that possessed some label or mark? That way, you would know they were secure before you bought them. Instead of buying them then finding out after a breach? A combination of standards and certifications may make that a reality in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance Product Security Working Group Launches the IoT Device Security Specification 1.0: The Connectivity Standards Alliance (“Alliance”) Product Security Working Group is pleased to announce the release of their IoT (Internet of Things) Device Security Specification 1.0, with the accompanying certification program, and Product Security Verified Mark. This groundbreaking initiative aims to establish a unified IoT cybersecurity standard and certification program, providing manufacturers a one-stop solution to certify their devices, enabling them to comply with multiple international regulations and standards more easily.

<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but it&rsquo;s time to demand our smart home devices are protected and that they are secure. Only invest in devices that show labels that meet the IoT Device Security Specification 1.0. Your family&rsquo;s privacy and safety relies on your vigilance.</p>

<h2 id="attention">Attention</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your teacher said you misbehaved in class. Bow your head and pray for guidance and how you can better behave in class,&rdquo; said Rev. Johnson, a chaplain at a public school in Texas. Surprised? You shouldn&rsquo;t be. Can you see public schools where your school counselor has been replaced by a religious chaplain? It doesn&rsquo;t matter what your family believes, Catholic, Protestant, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness, Mormon, or Humanist. This is now happening across the United States or has the potential to happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>39 percent of schools reported that lack of access to licensed professionals and mental health funding were major roadblocks to their efforts supporting student mental health <strong><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2024-02-19-why-schools-still-struggle-to-provide-enough-mental-health-resources-for-students">source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="interest">Interest</h2>
<p>In Texas, this can already happen. The law has already been passed. It allows chaplains to serve as school counselors. Other states are ready to follow Texas' lead. Since there&rsquo;s a dearth of school counselors to fill positions in schools, similar laws offer a way out at a price. Can you say the Establishment clause?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, what constitutes an &ldquo;establishment of religion&rdquo; is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the &ldquo;Lemon&rdquo; test, government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. <strong><a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/first-amendment-and-religion">Source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are <strong><a href="https://firstliberty.org/news/helpful-info-for-tx-schools-considering-chaplains/">other perspectives on this issue</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="desire">Desire</h2>
<p>While some say it&rsquo;s about meeting a dire need, given the gaps in available counselors, some says it&rsquo;s about indoctrinating students in Christianity. What does the insertion of chaplains into schools mean for American democracy at a time when Christian Nationalism is on the rise? Why are laws pushing for chaplains instead of mental health professionals?</p>
<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>Can Americans who believe in the separation of church and state sit idly by? Should we? It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you fit in on your beliefs, or if you are a student, parent, educator, or community member. It&rsquo;s critical to push back against the infiltration of religion into public schools. We must protect our children&rsquo;s access to unbiased, mental health support. Leave religion for private religious schools (which in the interests of full disclosure, I attended PreK-12).</p>

<p>What a disappointing development, if not for sports, for America&rsquo;s claim to prizing diversity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black college athletes should rethink any decision to attend public colleges and universities in Florida, the NAACP advised in an extraordinary letter issued in response to efforts by Gov.

<p>As to coming up with a scope-n-sequence, it would have to be aligned to ISTE Standards and keep COPPA in mind. When people ask, &ldquo;How are you introducing AI to students in K-8, or under 13 year olds?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m a bit stymied. First, why would you want to, and second, there&rsquo;s a lot to learn aside from AI. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to spend time on that first? Of course, it&rsquo;s silly to think parents aren&rsquo;t already giving their children, even under 13 year olds, access to AI chatbots. The problem is, the responses are a lot more &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; than Alexa or Siri&hellip;and those are going to be improved on, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For students under 13, direct interaction with AI tools will be limited and monitored by educators. Instead, the focus will be on understanding AI concepts and potential uses through guided activities and discussions. For older students, direct use of AI tools will be incorporated into projects with an emphasis on critical thinking and ethical considerations. Microsoft CoPilot and Google Gemini can be integrated into research and data analysis activities for grades 6-12, with educators ensuring that students understand how to use these tools responsibly and effectively.</p>

<li>If chil- dren are able to use AI, they must be able to identify it, know how it works, and understand that they have the agency to change it.</li>
<li>We need to give students these skills so that they are empowered to decide how they would like AI to fit into their lives.</li>
<li>To meet this need, we developed a curriculum with three primary goals:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Students should be conscientious consumers of AI.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Students should be ethical designers of AI.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Students should be able to participate in democratic discussions
around AI.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Given the pervasive impact AI is having on the global economy and society, for good or for bad, it is imperative to educate an AI literate citizenry. If we’re to educate and train the next generation of AI makers, we need to empower them with the tools and conceptual frameworks to design these systems ethically.</li>
<li>Research suggests that isolating ethics from technical content often leads students to perceive ethics as unrelated to their technical studies</li>

			 <p>I found myself scratching my head over <strong><a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/75784/editorial/chatgpt-the-write-tool-for-classroom-success/">this article</a></strong>. Something about it rubbed me wrong. Then I realized what it was. The arguments made for AI are the same as the ones made for XYZ edtech back in the day of Apple //e and Macintosh LC II computers, word processors, and databases, etc. In essence, the old arguments were dragged out, given a fresh coat of &ldquo;AI paint,&rdquo; then rushed into service.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="ai-is-a-critical-skill-for-curriculum">AI Is a Critical Skill for Curriculum</h2>
<p>Who benefits by putting AI into the curriculum? Who makes money off of this, and does AI distract from what students need to learn, which is how to process information, ideas, for long-term memory retention? Is critical thinking still of value, or is it more critical for Big Tech to push AI into school curriculum to ensure they get more money from school coffers?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Teaching students how to use ChatGPT properly is a critical skill that schools should incorporate into their curriculum</strong>. Education should prepare students to function effectively later in their lives by teaching them how to learn and how to use the tools of modern society. <strong><a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/75784/editorial/chatgpt-the-write-tool-for-classroom-success/">Source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I read this, I&rsquo;m struck by how this argument was the same one edtech advocates relied on before. It&rsquo;s an old argument that is less effective now. Human beings need to learn how to use the tools of modern society. Presumably, introducing them at an earlier age accustoms them to those tools.</p>
<h2 id="monetizing-children-with-tech">Monetizing Children with Tech</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that a possible reason big tech (e.g. Microsoft, Google) want those tech tools in the hands of children is so that when they become adult, they will continue to use them. A free child user now may very well translate into a paying adult user later. Big tech has a vested interest in introducing children to their ecosystems. Too cynical?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the late 1800s, new technology emerging from the Industrial Revolution offered commercial interests a new opportunity to monetize childhood—and those commercial interests took it. At the time, there were about 765,000 American child laborers, many working in extremely unsafe industrial conditions. Children suffered numerous harms, from crushed limbs and broken bones to death by industrial accidents like factory fires.</p>
<p>Big Tech’s social media platforms are similarly exploiting children today. And just as policymakers needed to act to protect children then, they must do the same now. The Digital Revolution has created new ways to exploit children for profit, and Big Tech has seized the opportunity enthusiastically. <strong>(<a href="https://americancompass.org/its-time-to-protect-children-from-big-tech/">source</a>)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As educators, as veteran edtech advocates, perhaps we need to be a little more critical and less &ldquo;pollyanna&rdquo; about yesterday&rsquo;s edtech adoptions in schools.</p>
<h2 id="a-side-trip-into-meaninglessness">A Side Trip into Meaninglessness</h2>
<p>Ever since I started blogging, I&rsquo;ve been reading Harold Jarche&rsquo;s work. His ideas on knowledge management certainly pushed me into knowledge management in the organizations I worked in, even if I was the only one doing it (er, oops). I found this quote he includes in his piece, <strong><a href="https://jarche.com/2024/03/careening-toward-a-meaningless-world/#more-26790">Careening Toward a Meaningless World</a></strong> from Andrew Perfors to speak to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More likely, while the rich might be able to create walled gardens of meaning, the system for most of us will become a swamp of falseness and distortion, a cursed transformation of humanity’s greatest asset – our cumulative cultural knowledge – into our greatest weakness. —Andrew Perfors 2024-02-14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible AI&rsquo;s incorporation into curriculum is yet another way of creating a walled garden of meaning? In the early days of blogging in schools, breaking down the classroom walls seemed a good thing. Now, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>The conspiracy or grand plan to exploit public schools is, at last, revealed. Move the children of the rich into private schools where they create meaning. For public schools, the goal is exploitation and redirecting funding into expensive curriculum innovations (like AI) that leave children mired in the swamp Perfors describes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, UTSA is establishing a new college focused on AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We don’t want [students] to spend time early in their careers just trying to figure out AI,” said Jonathon Halbesleben, dean of UTSA’s business school who is co-chairing a task force to establish the new college. “We’d love to have them be career-ready to jump right into the ability to sort of shape AI and how it’s used in their organizations.” <strong><a href="https://flip.it/ibZiMR">source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. It&rsquo;s something to think about and reflect on.</p>
<h2 id="ai-integration-into-student-work">AI Integration into Student Work</h2>
<p>Should we, as educators, be adopting the latest AI tech for use by students? Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to undo the technological innovations that ChatGPT has brought, and the engine is certainly not the last AI breakthrough. Students will have to be able to integrate AI into their work throughout their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using ChatGPT takes practice; phrasing prompts and devising creative uses for the AI requires skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that overreliance on ChatGPT can harm students’ learning. <strong><a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/75784/editorial/chatgpt-the-write-tool-for-classroom-success/">Source</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="if-not-ai-then-what">If Not AI, Then What?</h2>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s not be too hasty. There must be SOME use to AI in K-12 schools, especially for teachers. Consider the use of AI integration matched to high-effect sized instructional strategies.</p>

<p>Let me run my thoughts here through the FLOATER acronym through AI and see what it says:</p>
<p>To apply the FLOATER approach to the provided text and evaluate the claims made within it, we will assess each element of FLOATER and assign a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) based on the information given.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Evaluation</th>
<th>Score (1-5)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Falsifiability</td>
<td>The article questions the motives behind integrating AI into the curriculum and suggests that it could be driven by financial interests rather than educational benefits. This claim is falsifiable as it can be tested by examining the financial relationships between tech companies and educational institutions.</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logic</td>
<td>The argument that AI might be pushed into schools for profit rather than educational value follows a logical structure, but it may not consider the full range of reasons for AI integration, such as genuine educational benefits.</td>

<td>The article does consider alternative explanations for the push of AI into schools, such as the historical context of technology in education and potential exploitation.</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tentative Conclusions</td>
<td>The article raises questions and presents a critical view without making definitive conclusions, suggesting a level of tentativeness.</td>

</table>
<p>The overall FLOATER analysis suggests that while the article raises important questions and provides a critical perspective on the integration of AI into education, it may lack objectivity and sufficient evidence to fully support its claims. The scores reflect a need for more balanced reporting and comprehensive evidence to strengthen the arguments presented.</p>

			 <p>Reading over one of my old blog entries from <em>Around the Corner</em> (I hope to get it back on track at its old web address, mguhlin.org on April 29th or 30th, by the way), I stumbled on this Indian proverb from 2008. It captures an insight into a situation a colleague described.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-situation">The Situation</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why tell us to travel and attend conferences elsewhere, while at the same time saying there is insufficient funds? Is it supposed to make us want to travel, or give the person permission to travel while secretly saying, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no money.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo; Her issue was with the school district who had implemented austerity measures, even though local admin were traveling to Boston for specialized training.</p>
<h2 id="presenting-a-paper-nope">Presenting a Paper, Nope!</h2>
<p>Her complaint reminded me of a situation I experienced when I was a poor classroom teacher. Allow me to share a complaint of my own&hellip;tt was one of my least favorite situations as a young married couple with two children was getting a paper accepted at an AERA conference. I was quite proud to get a paper accepted, and I was looking forward to presenting it.</p>
<p>The AERA conference would have been my first professional presentation of a research paper. The university office with graduate studies said, &ldquo;We can defray the cost of the travel by $500,&rdquo; which would have been perfect. But they couldn&rsquo;t provide the money until AFTER I returned from the event. As you might imagine, I ended up being accepted to the conference but unable to pay for  travel and lodging.</p>
<p>Whatever money I had at the time was tied up with children and other costs. Who has $500 to spend bills, two kids, a mortgage, etc.? I was quite disappointed. I had my heart set on going. I should have kept Epictetus in mind (but I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of him back then!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.&rdquo; -Epictetus
;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a big deal. I am older, wiser, and probably could have figured something else to make the money. Back then, my younger self was worn out, tired, and unable to take on another money-making scheme to be away from home and young children. In fact, that was a negative to going&hellip;leaving my wife to handle the family alone. I took the wrong message from that experience, and didn&rsquo;t bother trying to submit papers since I was too broke to travel.  It&rsquo;s one of those situations when you focus on cramming too much into a short period of time. I see it all the time now to other folks, and I realize now what the mistake I made was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my colleague&rsquo;s complain hit home. Why would an organization like a school district spend money to send someone anywhere while at the same time complaining there was no funding? All that did was make me think, &ldquo;This is a waste of money to go present or do anything remotely. The real message from the school leadership?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I am telling everyone to travel, I know you&rsquo;re going to turn it down because you want  to save the budget, but I want it to appear as if it was YOU, not me, who made the decision to not travel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who does travel is actually a jerk, because they are taking money away from a strapped budget.</p>
<h2 id="the-proverb">The Proverb</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this proverb that I originally got from <strong><a href="https://coolcatteacher.blogspot.com/2008/02/dont-cut-off-noses-and-hand-out-roses.html">Vicki Davis back in 2008</a></strong>, is so apt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is no point in cutting off a person&rsquo;s nose and then giving them a rose to smell.&rdquo;
-Indian proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems appropriate to me. There&rsquo;s money to travel, but you can&rsquo;t have it until you get back. If you don&rsquo;t have the money up front, you can&rsquo;t travel, so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that the money IS available.</p>

			 <p>Wish you had ONE place to post your digital notes? While I keep a handwritten notebook or 10 around the house to keep track of my notes, usually ones that I want to process nice and slow, there are some things you just copy-n-paste. That place, if it&rsquo;s not a blog, is (or was) my account on <strong><a href="https://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote.com</a></strong>. That is, until recently, when I found myself unable to login via my computer&rsquo;s web browsers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not just locked out of one browser because of errant cookies, but all of them. I know, I tried. The ReCaptcha for <strong><a href="https://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote.com</a></strong> must be set wrong or something, because it rejected every attempt I made. After one session, I doubted if I knew what motorcycles and bicycles and buses looked like, really. I even found a forum on <strong><a href="https://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote.com</a></strong>&rsquo;s website where others had been experiencing issues exactly the same as mine.</p>
<h2 id="hasta-la-vista-simplenote">Hasta la Vista, SImpleNote</h2>
<p>Although I have a few shared notes on <strong><a href="https://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote.com</a></strong>, it was a quick, easy place to access from anywhere and drop notes I could then share with others. That&rsquo;s the part that bugs me, not being able to quickly share content with a colleague. It&rsquo;s not the only place, but I&rsquo;d gotten accustomed to using <strong><a href="https://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote.com</a></strong> from any device. Now, I can only access it from my iPhone. Until the issue gets resolved, I migrated all my notes via copy-n-paste on my mobile app to a new solution. That was NOT fun.</p>

<a href="https://joplinapp.org/images/home-top-img-2x.webp"></a></p>
<p>Joplin has made some major improvements since I last explored it a few years ago, and I am considering jumping into Joplin Cloud given all the enhancements it&rsquo;s made. I am excited about the idea of doing my composing for this blog in Joplin, then copy-n-pasting into micro.blog.</p>
<p>Markdown has become all the more important given its one of the formats AI can export content to. It&rsquo;s also the format for micro.blog (thank goodness), and that&rsquo;s pretty fantastic.</p>
<h2 id="joplin-features">Joplin Features</h2>
<p>Some features of this versatile tool include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access your notes from your computer, phone or tablet by synchronising with various services, including Joplin Cloud, Dropbox and OneDrive. The app is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. A terminal app is also available!</li>
<li>Images, videos, PDFs and audio files are supported. Create math expressions and diagrams directly from the app. Take photos with the mobile app and save them to a note.</li>
<li>Save web pages as notes. Use the web clipper extension, available on Chrome and Firefox, to save web pages or take screenshots as notes.</li>
<li>The app is open source and your notes are saved to an open format, so you&rsquo;ll always have access to them. Uses End-To-End Encryption (E2EE) to secure your notes and ensure no-one but yourself can access them.</li>
<li>Customise the app with plugins, custom themes and multiple text editors (Rich Text or Markdown). Or create your own scripts and plugins using the Extension API.</li>
</ul>

<p>I stumbled on a selection of writing earlier today. It had appeared in an online publication that made poor use of it. I ran it through AI and realized,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wow, this is like uncovering a long buried treasure, cleaning off the grime and seeing it for what it truly is, without layers of interpretation that distort its meaning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-revised-version">The Revised Version</h2>
<p>Here is the revised version of the text. You can see the reference to the original later below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer guidance to those who act without considering the consequences.</li>
<li>Support and uplift those who are disheartened.</li>
<li>Assist those in need and show patience to everyone.</li>
<li>Ensure that harm is not returned with harm. Strive for the well-being of each other and all people.</li>
<li>Find joy in every moment.</li>
<li>Remain open-minded and grateful in all situations.</li>
<li>Keep your enthusiasm and curiosity alive.</li>
<li>Be open to new ideas and experiences, but critically evaluate them. Embrace what is beneficial.</li>
<li>Avoid harmful actions and influences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty amazing, right? Quite humanist, and wise. That’s why you may find it different from the source, <strong>I Thessalonians 5:14-22.</strong></p>

<p>One of the questions I have, even after attending a recent <strong><a href="https://convention.tcea.org">2024 Convention</a></strong> is, &ldquo;How do these AI solutions compare to each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, I wondered as I saw clusters of folks huddled around, I asked myself, &ldquo;As an administrator, why would I invest in more than one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The response from some of the vendors was, &ldquo;Yes, you should buy this and that. Only one said,&ldquo;We&rsquo;re one stop shopping for a school AI solution.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We&rsquo;re coming up on a ton of political campaigns, and it was those that spurred me to take a look again at SIFT, which others have mentioned, but I had only briefly explored. After studying up on it, I realized how valuable it can be for the classroom as a tool for critical thinking.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But I also would want to combine it with something Melanie Trecek-King (<strong><a href="https://thinkingispower.com">ThinkingIsPower.com</a></strong> called, <em>Systematic Disconfirmation</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of systematic disconfirmation involves actively seeking out and considering evidence or cases that contradict or challenge existing beliefs, theories, or findings. Disconfirmation bias, for example, refers to the tendency of individuals to more readily accept information that supports their pre-existing beliefs and dismiss information that contradicts them. This bias can lead to a lack of fair evaluation of arguments that deviate from one&rsquo;s own beliefs, hindering true collaboration and compromise.
Disconfirmation bias is linked to <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>, where conflicting thoughts or information can lead to discomfort or mental distress, prompting individuals to dismiss disconfirming evidence to maintain their beliefs or identity (<strong><a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/disconfirmation-bias-definition-theory-example.html">source</a></strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can definitely see a lot of that when holding up what I believe or hold true, only to discover it&rsquo;s not. Melanie mentions the terms in passing in one of her published writings, and its evident its not a new term. That said, I had never heard of it described in that way. Learning about it is great, though. How do you go about systematically disconfirming what hold as gospel or think is true?</p>
<h2 id="a-systematic-disconfirmation-process">A Systematic Disconfirmation Process</h2>
<p>One process suggested is this one:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify</strong>: Determine the existing belief or theory that needs to be tested.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesize</strong>: Formulate expectations based on the identified belief or theory.</li>
<li><strong>Collect</strong>: Gather data or evidence relevant to the belief or theory.</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong>: Contrast the collected evidence against the initial expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Disconfirm</strong>: Identify evidence that contradicts or challenges the initial belief or theory.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong>: Examine the disconfirming evidence to understand its implications.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust</strong>: Modify the original belief or theory based on the analysis of disconfirming evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>: Continue the process iteratively to refine the belief or theory further.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, a simplification might be helpful. I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty simple, but if teaching it to middle school students, simpler language may be called for, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find</strong>: Look for what you think is true.</li>
<li><strong>Guess</strong>: Make a guess about what you expect based on what you think.</li>
<li><strong>Get</strong>: Collect information or facts related to your guess.</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: Look at the information to see if it matches your guess.</li>
<li><strong>Spot</strong>: Notice any information that doesn&rsquo;t match what you thought.</li>
<li><strong>Think</strong>: Think about what the mismatching information means.</li>
<li><strong>Change</strong>: Make changes to your original thought based on new insights.</li>
<li><strong>Go again</strong>: Keep doing this process to refine your thoughts.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could even shorten or collapse the steps further, although I&rsquo;m not sure how useful that is:</p>

<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-systematic-disconfirmation-with-an-example">Digging Deeper into Systematic Disconfirmation with an Example</h2>
<p>In simple words, systematic disconfirmation means &ldquo;actively testing and challenging existing assumptions and theories&rdquo; (Source: Perplexity.ai gathered information). An example of systematic disconfirmation with a middle school science topic of &ldquo;force and motion&rdquo; looks like this according to AI:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example: Force and Motion</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Find</td>
<td>Look for what you think is true.</td>
<td>Students believe heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Guess</td>
<td>Make a guess about what you expect based on what you think.</td>
<td>Predict that when dropped from the same height, a textbook will hit the ground before a sheet of paper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Get</td>
<td>Collect information or facts related to your guess.</td>
<td>Perform an experiment by dropping objects of different masses from the same height.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check</td>
<td>Look at the information to see if it matches your guess.</td>
<td>Observe that all objects hit the ground at the same time when air resistance is negligible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spot</td>
<td>Notice any information that doesn&rsquo;t match what you thought.</td>
<td>Notice that the sheet of paper and the textbook hit the ground simultaneously in a vacuum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Think</td>
<td>Think about what the mismatching information means.</td>
<td>Conclude that mass does not affect the falling speed in the absence of air resistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Change</td>
<td>Make changes to your original thought based on new insights.</td>
<td>Update the belief to understand that gravity accelerates all objects equally when air resistance is not a factor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Go again</td>
<td>Keep doing this process to refine your thoughts.</td>
<td>Test with different shapes and sizes of objects to further explore the concept of air resistance and motion.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: What a time-saver to have an AI <strong><a href="https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=DMX9OZJ4">(learn more)</a></strong> put that table together. Just doing that would have been the whole time I have to write a blog entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the 3-step version would look like:
Using the 3-step process of systematic disconfirmation to analyze the belief that &ldquo;students believe heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones,&rdquo; we can structure the analysis as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example: Heavier vs. Lighter Objects Falling</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hypothesize</td>
<td>Form an idea or belief based on what you think is true.</td>
<td>Students think heavier objects, like a textbook, fall faster than lighter ones, like a feather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test</td>
<td>Collect and compare information to see if it supports or contradicts your idea.</td>
<td>Conduct an experiment dropping two objects of different masses but similar shapes from the same height in a vacuum to eliminate air resistance. Reference[2] and[19] provide insights into experiments and theoretical explanations showing that without air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate due to gravity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Revise</td>
<td>Based on the test results, adjust your idea or belief.</td>
<td>If the experiment shows that both objects hit the ground at the same time, conclude that the initial belief was incorrect. Update the belief to understand that in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass, as explained by the universal law of gravitation[12][19].</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process worth reflecting about when you encounter anything, no matter which version you use like the 8 step or 3 step approach.</p>

<p>For fun, here&rsquo;s the 3-step process of systematic disconfirmation applied to the same bit of DOGOnews in the blog entry:</p>

<td>AI software is trained on Beethoven&rsquo;s existing works and the unfinished sketches of the 10th Symphony. The AI then generates music based on this training, which is reviewed by music experts to determine if it aligns with Beethoven&rsquo;s style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Revise</td>
<td>Based on the test results, adjust your idea or belief.</td>
<td>If the AI-generated music is deemed consistent with Beethoven&rsquo;s style and intentions by experts, the hypothesis is supported. If not, the approach or AI model may need to be adjusted to better capture Beethoven&rsquo;s musical language.</td>

			 <p>&ldquo;Is there a way to share feedback and ideas with one another that works well?&rdquo; The question had come up at a particular group&rsquo;s team-building getaway.</p>
<p>Two of the participants suggested Shari Harley&rsquo;s book, <em><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AY79L0O/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">How To Say Anything to Anyone</a></strong></em>. They were hoping to short-circuit a longer, impersonal process that maybe didn&rsquo;t get to the heart of the issues facing the team.</p>
<p>I found the story intriguing and since I hadn&rsquo;t heard of the book, I decided to read it. Here&rsquo;s a video of her speaking:

<p>Below, you will find some of my notes from the book.</p>
<h1 id="my-notes">My Notes</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Harley introduces several scenarios where candor has been missing from relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harley says everyone is a wimp because they fail to speak up about the things that disappoint them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to cause conflict, hurt our feelings, or damage the relationship. But when someone does not speak up, the relationship is damaged anyway. If the offending behavior continues, friends drift away and the relationship dies.&rdquo; This is quite true, isn&rsquo;t it? How many work relationships have died in this way?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of my favorite questions that Harley asks is:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many &ldquo;happy&rdquo; employees suddenly left your organization? The reason why is they had ongoing frustrations and dissatisfactions. But they chose not to say anything. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guessing is an inefficient way of finding out what others are thinking or saying behind your back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harley advises to not guess what people want or what they think about your performance. Ask them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest points Harley makes is this very important one below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In candid cultures, coworkers, employers, and employees say what they need to say quickly and easily. They have created relationships in which all parties can speak openly without concern.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is, in most cultures (including K-12 districts), that&rsquo;s NOT the case, is it? I worked in one organization where everyone ACTED happy but was not. In fact, they were afraid for their jobs. When people chose to leave, they were afraid to say why, except to lie and say everything was awesome. Ugh, the stress of that is unbelievable.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-how-to-establish-candid-relationships">Chapter 1: How to Establish Candid Relationships</h2>
<p>The main point Harley makes is that most people haven&rsquo;t gotten permission to speak up. They have failed to make an agreement or contract about speaking up about tough issues. She asks the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you started every relationship by creating an agreement about how you will treat each other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She encourages you to make an agreement with others, then to post that agreement with a fallback/consequence.  The fallback &ldquo;is a consequence that a group agrees to when people violate agreements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley offers a few examples of ways to get prior permission from others:</p>
<p><strong>Coworkers:</strong> “I want a good relationship with you. If we work together long enough, I’m sure I’ll screw it up. I’ll wait too long to reply to an email, make a mistake, or miss a deadline. I’d like the kind of<br>
relationship in which we can talk about these things. I always want to know what you think. And I promise that no matter what you tell me, I’ll say thank you. Is it okay if I work this way with you?”<br>
<strong>Supervisors:</strong> I’m committed to my professional development. As such, I’m always looking for growth opportunities. I hope that if you hear me say or see me do or see me wear anything that gets in the way of how I want to be seen, you will tell me. I promise I’ll be receptive and say thank you. I also, of course, hope you’ll tell me the things I do well that are in line with your expectations.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-you-get-what-you-ask-for">Chapter 2: You Get What You Ask For</h2>
<p>Most relationships &ldquo;lack a verbal contract,&rdquo; says Harley. Such a contract delineates who does what and how issues that arise will be managed. She suggests that if there are problems, people may feel like they can&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Shari Harley outlines some steps on how to set expectations with others. This is a face to face meeting. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>State your goal. </li>
<li>Set expectations</li>
<li>Agree on how you will work together</li>
<li>Ask for feedback</li>
<li>Ask for permission to give feedback</li>
<li>Agree on roles</li>
<li>Agree on the communication process</li>
</ol>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.leadershipandsalestraining.com/sayanything"><strong>watch videos online</strong></a>. The book has scripts for each step shown above.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-taking-the-mystery-out-of-working-with-others">Chapter 3: Taking the Mystery out of Working with Others</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don’t guess or assume what others find frustrating —ask them. Teach people how to work with you by telling them how you like to work and by asking how they prefer to work with you,&rdquo; says Harley. She goes on to share several questions. The purpose of these is to gain insight into working-style preferences.</p>
<p>For example, she asks:</p>
<ul>
<li>how do you best like to communicate?</li>
<li>are you a morning, afternoon or night person?</li>
<li>if we need to talk, do you prefer to work by appointments or would you prefer I drop by? Or give you a call?</li>
<li>What is the best way to reach you after hours and what times work best?</li>
<li>What are your pet peeves?</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these are questions best done face to face for the purpose of building rapport. It&rsquo;s all about relationships, you know. She recommends putting the answers to these and other question in a paper or digital file with their answers.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-how-to-create-candid-managerial-relationships">Chapter 4: How To Create Candid Managerial Relationships</h2>
<p>Managers need to be able to answer at least two questions about each employee:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are three things that will keep you with the organization?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the one thing that would make you leave the organization?</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the scenarios (Hilary and the CEO) is spot on. In the scenario Harley shares Hilary&rsquo;s thinking, which captures the internal conversation employees have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If my boss knows I’m unhappy and there is no other role for me, I’ll be dismissed, perhaps not literally but figuratively. I won’t be given decent raises or new opportunities if my boss thinks I’m unhappy and thus on my way out. What happens if the company takes action before I’m ready? If I’m going to leave, it’s going to be on my own terms.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Believe it or not, that&rsquo;s the exact same story I told myself early in my career. In fact, it&rsquo;s advice that several colleagues have shared over my work life. My Dad even backed it up with a wise saying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are unhappy, make silent preparations to leave. Don&rsquo;t let on that you are unhappy with the boss until you have another job lined up. Only then can you leave but don&rsquo;t burn any bridges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,&rdquo; as my Dad would say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit dishonest, isn&rsquo;t it? But what can you do when the boss has all the power to ruin your life? You have to take steps to protect your livelihood.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5gYwHyG_Rw">Video:</a></strong></p>
<p>Harley points this out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of your mature employees (read: older than thirty) will not tell you what they need or when they’re unhappy. Instead, they’ll gut it out hoping things will improve. In the meantime, their morale and productivity will drop, because unhappy employees are never as productive as those who are satisfied. And eventually they’ll leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That behavior is something I&rsquo;ve seen time and again. But you know what? It&rsquo;s only now that I have millennials for children that I&rsquo;ve started to see the following behavior for younger workers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most young employees won’t hang in there for a few years, waiting to see whether things improve. If after a few months they aren’t happy and don’t see things getting better, they will be out the door and onto the next opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing is that younger workers won&rsquo;t wait for a new job. They&rsquo;ll walk away without a new job waiting, hoping they will find another. That&rsquo;s incredible.<br>
Harley offers additional questions to ask employees, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What three things do you need in a job to be satisfied?</li>
<li>What do you enjoy doing most?</li>
<li>What is something you want to do that you have never had a chance to do?</li>
<li>What skill would you like to develop?</li>
<li>How do you like to receive recognition for a job well done (public/private)?</li>
<li>Why did you accept this job?</li>
<li>What are you hoping this job will provide?</li>
<li>What are your concerns?</li>
<li>How will I know when you&rsquo;re frustrated and need support?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are great questions for managers to ask employees.<br>
I LOVE this point that is made in the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human beings have a need to know. When we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening and why, we make things up and talk about them to whomever will listen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the absence of knowledge, people fill in the gaps. And it&rsquo;s never good. Give more information than you think you need to give.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Managers should ask employees a few more questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is working for you about my management style?</li>
<li>What do you wish I could do more?</li>
<li>What would you like me to start, stop and continue doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure these questions would ever get candid responses in some workplaces. Can you imagine answering a micro-managing boss who might only be going through the motions of asking? I remember one supervisor that I encountered in my early career who would have fired people for being so candid. Fortunately, she was re-assigned.</p>
<h3 id="the-feedback-formula">The Feedback Formula</h3>
<p>This may be worth the price of the book alone. It&rsquo;s the 8 steps that make it possible to say anything to anyone in two minutes or less. At least, that&rsquo;s what Shari Harley says.</p>
<ol>
<li>Intro the conversation. Explain what you&rsquo;re going to talk about and why. </li>
<li>Empathize</li>
<li>Described the observed behavior.  Start with &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed&hellip;.&rdquo; </li>
<li>Share the impact or result of the behavior</li>
<li>Have some dialogue, ask for the recipient&rsquo;s perception of the situation</li>
<li>Make a suggestion/request for what you&rsquo;d like the person to do next time</li>
<li>Build an agreement on next steps</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>In reading these 8 steps, I&rsquo;m reminded of Crucial Conversations/Confrontations&hellip;.from memory those go something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share an agreed upon expectation of behavior</li>
<li>Share what happened</li>
<li>Ask about the gap between expected and actual behavior while being curious, keeping it safe, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Lots more great stuff in the book but I don&rsquo;t want to give it all away. Definitely check it out! It&rsquo;s full of insights that are accurate and wise, like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For women, the bathroom is a prime location for “the meeting after the meeting.” Women walk into the bathroom after a meeting in which some new, stupid policy was announced, see their friends who were in the same meeting, and talk. But they check under the stalls first to make sure they’re alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Women know men don’t do this. Men are in and out, and no one had best speak to them in the men’s room. But men have been wondering for years why women go to the bathroom in groups and are gone for twenty minutes. Well, now you know. We’re talking about you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing, right? Check it out.</p>

<p>Yikes, diet sodas are bad for you. I&rsquo;m still able to buy them everywhere I go. I may have some of this heart stumping brew in my pantry. Whether you drink diet or regular, it can still impact you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the study indicates that people who drank more than two liters of diet beverages per week were 20 percent more likely to develop a-fib than those who don&rsquo;t drink any&hellip;drinking more than two liters per week of conventionally sweetened cola saw a 10 percent increase in a-fib symptoms. <strong>(<a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/diet-soda-heart-issues">source</a>)</strong></p>

<p>No worries, though, you can apparently drink some fruit juice and counteract the effects&hellip;that&rsquo;s how it works, right? Maybe not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking at the portion of the cohort that drank only pure, unsweetened fruit or vegetable juice, the researchers found something even more fascinating: they appeared to have an eight percent lower risk of developing irregular heartbeats than their soda-drinking counterparts.</p>

			 <p>Figuring out what to present on is always fun for conferences and events. In educational technology, it&rsquo;s easy to pick the tech tool of the week and do a session on that. Right now, you can pick any assortment of formative assessment tools and AI platforms that are jumping into the space. But surveys like the one featured below always leave me wondering, &ldquo;Are we wasting our time? What do teachers really want to know?&rdquo; Fortunately, digital tools fall into the areas of interest for educators.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="blending-tech-into-teaching-and-learning">Blending Tech into Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>Over time, many teachers become better at educating as they learn more about high-effect instructional strategies, how to better manage their classrooms, and build relationships with students and colleagues. Not surprisingly, all of this is reflected in the survey below.</p>
<p>The question is, &ldquo;How can we build better PD that springs from the campus and district community?&rdquo; When I worked in a small, urban district (mostly shut down now due to being land-locked, and parents putting their students in charter schools or leaving the district altogether), one of the assistant principals liked to say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everything we need to know is right here. Everybody we need to learn from is here. Why do we need to go outside of the District and pay fancy consultants?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was an argument. I may have made it myself. These days, many school districts have built capacity, selectively bringing in presenters that enhance their work. For them, it IS about amplifying the voices of their in-house staff.</p>
<h1 id="the-survey">The Survey</h1>
<p>EdWeek&rsquo;s Market Brief has some interesting things to say about professional development for educators, highlighting findings from an <em><a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/state-teaching-4-takeaways-education-companies-market/">Education Week</a></em> report on <strong><a href="https://www.edweek.org/the-state-of-teaching">The State of Teaching</a></strong>.
It warns about four key areas identified in the <strong><a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/introducing-the-teacher-morale-index/2024/03">Teacher Morale Index</a></strong>:</p>
<h2 id="area-1-irrelevant-pd">Area #1: Irrelevant PD</h2>
<p>How can those who facilitate and deliver professional development make their workshops more <strong>relevant</strong> to classroom teachers, 48% of which complain it is not? Also, that they (19%) simply got too much professional development?</p>
<h2 id="area-2-more-digital-tools">Area #2: More Digital Tools</h2>
<p>Teachers (13%) say they &ldquo;need training on using technology or digital tools&rdquo; in an effective manner. Other needs identified by teachers include more professional development on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivating and engaging students</li>
<li>Classroom management, discipline, and/or student behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>In aggregate, the following areas add up to 31%:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classroom-based coaching and feedback on teaching techniques and strategies</li>
<li>PD on infusing SEL into their work</li>
<li>Help responding to curriculum shift in their district</li>
<li>Help deepening their understanding of the content they teach</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="area-3-desire-more-autonomy">Area #3: Desire More Autonomy</h2>
<p>Teachers want more autonomy and control over what they teach in the classroom.</p>
<h2 id="area-4-improve-morale">Area #4: Improve Morale</h2>
<p>Teachers are bummed out about school and their jobs. This accounts for 55% of teachers in urban schools who fight to stay motivated on the job.</p>

			 <p>Establishing a writing hub, a space to save your digital writing, has become all the more necessary. There are several reasons why, one of which <strong><a href="https://zirk.us/@glecharles">Guy LeCharles Gonzalez</a></strong> describes below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writers who write just to write and share their work still benefit from having a main hub. I lost so much writing over the years to platforms and websites that went under, now only the ephemeral stuff goes without archiving it in some way on my own blog. Post-Twitter, I&rsquo;m really hoping to see a revival in blogging, and it&rsquo;s slowly happening in some circles <strong>(<a href="https://zirk.us/@glecharles/112054560637160431">source</a>)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to lose writing on this or that platform, make sure you keep a copy. Even when you have a grasp of the technologies involved, it&rsquo;s easy to lose track.</p>
<h2 id="keep-an-inventory">Keep an Inventory</h2>
<p>One of the things I did for many years, but have since stopped doing, was keeping a list of everything I&rsquo;d ever written. When I got up past 100 print publications, thousands of blog entries, I realized a list of published writings in my resume and CV was unreasonable. Instead, I made a folder in my Google Drive to archive and save everything for&hellip;who knows when? I kept copies of the print magazines.</p>
<p>Then, one day, I woke up and threw all those magazines, except the first one, out. Who was going to want to keep this stuff after I died? I had only kept a few copies to show my family, but once my parents were dead, it wasn&rsquo;t like my children were going to want it.</p>
<h2 id="safeguarding-my-writing">Safeguarding My Writing</h2>
<p>From that point forward, I resolved to keep copies of the markdown version of the articles. Unfortunately, my employers didn&rsquo;t care for some of my writing and asked me to take it offline. Often, it highlighted a lack of integrity or transparency in their business dealings with a particular vendor. Other times, they pointed out that if I wrote a blog entry for the organization&rsquo;s blog, they didn&rsquo;t want to see it appear elsewhere on the web. I&rsquo;d written, after all, under work for hire. So, I found a way to keep those examples of my writing in a safe place, readable in my collection only by me. The public version appeared out there.</p>
<p>The problem is one that many writers run into, even when they are allowed to retain the copyright from their employer.</p>
<h2 id="a-mess">A Mess</h2>
<p>Today, what I really have, is a jumbled mess of stored writings in different places online. What really irritates me is the impermanence of publishers who said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, this will be online forever,&rdquo; but then failed to maintain the tech undergirding the publications or simply allowed the servers to die when new management came on board. In the end, the only copy of my work is the one I keep. As Guy says, so much can be lost.</p>
<p>I often wonder if, &ldquo;Did this piece of writing do what it set out to do? If so, then that&rsquo;s good enough. Who needs my writing for posterity, anyways?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="a-blogging-resurgence">A Blogging Resurgence?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure there is going to be a blogging resurgence. It costs money to maintain your own writing hub, and even if it gives you a voice, it also gives your enemies and antagonists insight into your thinking. Today&rsquo;s environment could be turning fascist. That either will spur you to stand up more visibly, or resort to notebooks of the mind, unreadable by anyone except you.</p>

			 <p>Looking for amazing books to read? Well, so am I! I found myself on a bit of a buying spree when it comes to books these past few days, probably since I spent so much time in waiting rooms with a family member. As much as I love reading on my phone, I found myself longing for a paper book without the distractions of a email, social media, etc. popping up as banner notices.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2>
<p>A few of the books I read came about as recommendations from listening to the <strong><a href="https://thinkingclearly.libsyn.com/website">Thinking Clearly</a></strong> podcast. Melanie Trecek-King (Thinking Is Power website) introduced me, inadvertently as I was researching my critical thinking blogs and presentations. She was a guest on Thinking Clearly, and I&rsquo;ve identified a few of my favorite podcasts from their series. I have had so much fun listening to Bob Froehlich and Julia.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>My favorites feature Melanie Trecek-King. They include the following:</p>

</ul>
<p>In anticipation of the 2024 election, I would listen to these three podcasts at least:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Of course, there are TONS of great podcasts with YEARS of content. I intend to listen to all of them at some point, but one is an education in and of itself. All of them, well, it may as well be a university education in Critical Thinking.</p>
<h2 id="books-to-read">Books To Read</h2>
<p>Given all that content to listen to, I&rsquo;m finding myself split between text and audio. Some of the books I have on my shelf to read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Foolproof-Misinformation-Infects-Minds-Immunity/dp/039388144X">Foolproof: Why MisInformation Infects Our Minds and How to Build Immunity</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231201389?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">Partial Truths: How Fractions Distort Our Thinking</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://a.co/d/gByvyLA">Critical Thinking: The Antidote for Faith</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That last book is a deeper exploration of CRITIC, a critical thinking process I adapted for a workshop on critical thinking. I have to admit that I enjoyed the brief Skeptical Inquirer article over the book so far. Of course, the book is focused on knocking holes&hellip;or, revealing the holes already present&hellip;in religion and faith. It&rsquo;s a bit of a downer from that perspective and sure to raise the hackles of the faithful. Too bad Bartz didn&rsquo;t approach the text from solely critical thinking rather than going straight for the jugular of religious contradictions.</p>
<p>And, in a bit of old fiction (good to revisit &ldquo;old friends&rdquo;):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alas-Babylon-Frank-July-2005/dp/B015YMCTB6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1S52CEIS6VNPG&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.v1xKGDkx-jwFeh8HxfSKexv2lClMo8t_x9ZRzoIDmkVC1sHrqHftp1Xo61kQoHbRfneGQPdj-SNPrZ1PdBRAoX7PpnfY0nK5ALLkH3cteDrn0P2wKSeUPQNC52afOU-rCvyaWHzTXKgM4uhbTLoYZoQAtdLnUXraGEGRn5-LTNgP_TlOod4BDpJD4gX9EYIMgL1ucqBNXP1IWm4NRl-ONOXUeZ5d2CVLjL25hc_OI_4.FqvhcZkgkhxuV_OTFcaiBEnxM8TRCA2WlVg5HLr5Mrg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=alas+babylon&amp;qid=1709581083&amp;sprefix=alas+babylon%2Caps%2C108&amp;sr=8-4">Alas, Babylon</a></strong></li>

			 <p>The more research I read, the less inclined I am to reach for a keyboard when taking notes. That&rsquo;s because our brain makes more connections when we do things with pen and paper than with digital equivalents. </p>

<p>Reading that reminded me of something else I&rsquo;d read about the brain in Mike Bell&rsquo;s <em><strong><a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Fundamentals-of-Teaching-A-Five-Step-Model-to-Put-the-Research-Evidence/Bell/p/book/9780367358655">The Fundamentals of Teaching</a></strong></em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When repetition leads to long-term memories, there are physical changes in the brain. <strong>Brain memories disappear very quickly unless they are repeated</strong>. Our brains are made up of billions of nerve cells or neurons, all connected together. We form memories when some of these <strong>pathways become strengthened by being repeatedly used</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bell isn’t the only one with a great explanation.</p>
<h2 id="zaretta-hammond">Zaretta Hammond</h2>
<p>Zaretta Hammond, in <em><a href="https://crtandthebrain.com/about/">Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain</a></em>, explains it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the brain is learning something new, it clusters neurons together to create a neural pathway…when we go back and forth along this pathway, it helps drive new learning deeper into long-term memory until it becomes automatic or deeply understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>Mirjam Neelan, in her blog entry <strong><a href="https://3starlearningexperiences.wordpress.com/2022/05/09/how-to-support-learning-for-a-brain-thats-becoming-more-stupid-over-time/">How to Support Learning for a Brain That&rsquo;s Becoming More Stupid Over Time</a></strong>, suggests these actions to address the issue of how tech makes us stupid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spend more time on analysis</strong>. Could this involve more <strong><a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com/2022/03/mynotes-writing-in-middle-school.html">Claim-Evidence-Reasoning</a></strong>, Critical Thinking heuristics like <strong><a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com/2022/04/the-future-of-education.html?q=polya">Polya&rsquo;s</a></strong>? </li>
<li><strong>Integrate learning experiences into the work</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>Build stamina in critical thinking and analysis</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to read Mirjam&rsquo;s blog entry, but in the end, we need to focus on more retrieval practice, rely on evidence-based instructional strategies. </p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also a case to be made for&hellip;not filling your brain with bunk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As you acquire more memories, more and more of them become associated with familiar cues. It becomes harder and harder to retrieve any particular memory. “ (<strong><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/06/09/forgetting/">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess, if you don&rsquo;t want to store memories for the long-term, resolve to never think of them.</p>

<p>Quoting Greg Olear and Benjamin Cremer, William Lindsey shares the following via two Mastodon posts I couldn&rsquo;t pass up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Christian Nationalists’ God is petty, insecure, cruel, authoritarian. Their God, like their favored presidential candidate, demands above all else obedience and loyalty. Their God sees only a few as &lsquo;elect&rsquo;: Mike Johnson and his ilk, straight men, blastocysts and frozen embryos. All the others He casts out. Their God is not inclusive; their Paradise, a fascist state.&rdquo;
<strong><a href="https://gregolear.substack.com/p/sunday-pages-paradise-lost-d85">Source: Greg Olear</a> via <a href="https://zirk.us/@wdlindsy@toad.social/112071821784344976">William Lindsey</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What Christian Nationalism means by &hellip; &lsquo;Christian nation,&rsquo; is a nation dictated by neo-evangelical Christianity, tied to a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, which should drive the formation of laws, is deeply entrenched in patriarchy, and is largely white. This vision … not only excludes other religions and nonreligious people from having an equal voice in our country, but many other Christians&hellip;.&rdquo;
<strong><a href="https://benjamin-cremer.ck.page/posts/how-should-we-talk-about-christian-nationalism">Source: Benjamin Cremer</a></strong>  via <strong><a href="https://zirk.us/@wdlindsy@toad.social/112071830928345479">William Lindsey</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t pass up the opportunity to share my burgeoning understanding of Christian Nationalism, and the siren song that lures many believers to their doom. It seems so obvious now, but a few years ago, I suffered from my own set of scales over my eyes. I am reminded of this quote that applies to Christian Nationalists now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever fights monsters, should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster.” Friedrich Nietsche</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the monsters of the Christian nationalist are ones of his/her own imagining, as <strong><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/buttigieg-calls-katie-britts-misleading-sex-trafficking-victims/story?id=107964520">recent events demonstrate</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-response">A Response</h2>
<p>My response is far from perfect, composed via a mobile browser with word limits, so pardon the brevity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian Nationalism clarifies the fantasies it has sprung from. It is the rotten  fruit of a poisoned tree. A twisted tree itself grown from a seed planted in falsehood and nourished with the blood of the oppressed throughout history. Once you know the history of its grafts and grifts, its use as a tool of enslavement, only science with its checks and balances can offer any measure of objective truth. The CNs are deluded, chaff bound for unquenchable fire.🔥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, given the dark history of Christianity, its current incarnation a derivative of <strong><a href="https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/ancient-history/catholic-constantine/">an invented religion</a></strong> that little resembles the teachings after whom it&rsquo;s named, Christian Nationalism is a rejection of Jesus' teachings. After all, who in their right mind can imagine Jesus totin' an assault rifle, or failing to do more than offer <strong>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_and_prayers">thoughts and prayers</a>&quot;</strong> at the violent deaths of children in classrooms?</p>
<p>Given that response, I realized I had more to say:</p>
<p>Or to say it plain, they believe what they want because it empowers them to be “righteous “ while doing bad things against other people. Humans can’t see the world as it is, only as they perceive it.</p>
<p>For some, it is an evil world populated with powerful demons and do-nothing angels, only they are instruments of good. clinging to fake religion in the face of evidence makes them devils they imagined.</p>
<p>The irony? no evidence of their worst fears except their cruel actions towards others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When the stories that have glued together a culture lose their potency, things begin to fall apart. But new things rise up.&rdquo; -Elizabeth Lesser</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things are falling apart. Christian Nationalism is, I suspect, an awareness that the religion that has been constructed can&rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny, to the evidence. In the face of that evidence, a new story must be told.</p>
<p>In this new radicalized Christian Nationalism version, you do not turn the other cheek. You slap the other&rsquo;s cheek and worse. In this story, Jesus carries a long gun. Helping others is not the priority, but ensuring your own prosperity and that of fellow believers, is.</p>
<p>In this tale told but never real, only the approved version of righteous belief can be allowed to thrive. You believe as they, or suffer the consequences.</p>
<h2 id="lindseys-response">Lindsey&rsquo;s Response</h2>
<p>William is kind enough to respond to my response, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You put your finger very well on the central issue: from very early in American history, a powerful strand of thought among some of us has been that we are the righteous, and that means that everyone else is the unrighteous. This makes us good and makes even the evil we do good — so we choose to think. Well-stated. This is insightful and excellent commentary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>As I read his response, I recall Smith&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/10/mynotes-how-the.html">How the Word Is Passed</a></strong> and Lesser&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/08/mynotes-cassandra-speaks.html">Cassandra Speaks</a></strong> and I shudder at the <strong>horrors of an American nation bound</strong> and determined to do good with its eyes closed to its <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/09/mynotes-exploring-history.html">own past</a></strong>.</p>
<p>You might find Anne Lamott&rsquo;s quote (as cited in Elizabeth Lesser&rsquo;s <strong>Cassandra Speaks</strong>) as appropriate as I did:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“You can safely assume you’ve created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
-Anne Lamott</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Harold Jarche for sharing this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;America could not bear to take a hard look at itself, especially the inconvenient truths of slavery, dispossession and genocide. Religion and profit, ‘jumping together,’ had little time for introspection. The slaveholder, the frontiersman and the fundamentalist all hated the historian — and anti-intellectualism has been a strong force ever since.”
—Ronald Wright (2008) What is America?</p>

			 <p>How do you survive the AI Job Apocalypse that&rsquo;s coming? For many of us in education or related fields, it&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s a shift coming.

<h2 id="finding-ai-proof-jobs">Finding AI Proof Jobs</h2>
<p>Some time ago, I considered a post-retirement career change, something to keep me busy and from wasting away in the wasteland of retirement do-nothing. Averse to house and yard work, I found myself (tongue in cheek) sending a request for information to HVAC certification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), HVAC/R technician jobs are projected to grow 13% over the next eight years, which equals 46,300 new jobs. The BLS also states that the average salary for these developers is just under $49,000 per year with top earners making nearly $78,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my responses included this one from Jon Wayne HVAC, Plumbing and Electrical services in Texas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In as little as 6-12 weeks you are able to earn your certifications required by the state of Texas, as well as learn basic refrigeration, maintenance techniques and HVAC theory. Jon Wayne Service Company is not a school or an accredited course, so there is no cost or fees associated with this program. You would simply need to complete a job application. If selected, you are hired and paid to train.</p>
</blockquote>

There&rsquo;s a lot to process in that piece, so you&rsquo;ll want to read the complete piece. Here are the three solutions for folks:</p>
<h2 id="solution-1-for-individuals">Solution #1: For Individuals</h2>
<p>At <strong><a href="https://almosttimely.substack.com/p/almost-timely-news-the-intelligence">Almost Timely</a></strong>, the suggestion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an option for you, get skilled up with AI so that you&rsquo;re the one managing the machines. If you can do your work 10x faster with AI, and you&rsquo;re very skilled with it, your individual job may be safe even as your compatriots' positions aren&rsquo;t. If it&rsquo;s not an option to learn AI, then look at the jobs that are difficult to automate, work that is not templated. Trade jobs, for example&hellip;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&hellip;[you are a company that] prioritizes people over profits (with the understanding that you still have to run a business), can you commit to retraining and upskilling employees who are most at risk from AI? Can you help them learn how to scale their own work with AI? It might be more costly in the short term, but if those people become good at what they do, they can then take on more work without losing their jobs - and deliver more, better results for your company.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="for-marketers-specifically">For Marketers Specifically</h2>
<p>Though I only have a passing interest in marketing, I found this specific response quite interesting, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;From a marketing perspective, everything that can be AI, will be AI. As a marketer who wants to differentiate, double down on things that don&rsquo;t scale. Experiential marketing, where you create real world experiences, will grow in importance because it&rsquo;ll be unique, different, and compelling. Influencer marketing will continue to grow because personal brands and individual personalities will differentiate from more generic AI content. If you&rsquo;re not growing your own influencers inside your company, inside your marketing department, you&rsquo;re missing the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-reflection">A Quick Reflection</h2>
<p>I suspect that re-skilling to find a job that is AI-proof will mean dumping a lot of my own biases, many of which have been inculcated from youth and cultivated to give me a sense of superiority for pursuing college and university degrees. I put the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What attitudes do Gen Xers have regarding college/university advanced degrees vs trade school jobs that need to change? What might these attitudes change to make them more compatible with AI proof jobs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a lot of research out there about Gen X attitudes. The response, which appears in its entirety below, definitely is food for thought.</p>
<h3 id="ai-response-to-prompt-above">AI Response to Prompt Above</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the search results, it appears that there is a generational divide in attitudes towards college/university advanced degrees versus trade school jobs that may need to be addressed to better align with the realities of an AI-driven job market.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gen Xers, having experienced better job outcomes from college degrees than Millennials, may hold traditional views that a college education is the surest path to financial stability and career success[1]. However, with the rise of AI and automation, many jobs that previously required a college degree are becoming less secure, and the financial burden of education is growing[1][2]. Additionally, the availability of &ldquo;matched jobs,&rdquo; or jobs that require a college degree, is shrinking, leading to higher unemployment and underemployment among college graduates[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To adapt to the changing job landscape, Gen Xers may need to shift their attitudes to recognize the value of trade school jobs, which are often more difficult to automate and offer practical, hands-on skills that are in demand[1][4]. Trade jobs like carpentry, service sales, insurance sales, and plumbing are predicted to grow, adding more than 68,000 employees in each field between 2018 and 2028[1]. Embracing trade jobs as viable and respectable career options could provide a more secure future in an AI-dominated economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some attitudes that Gen Xers might consider changing to become more compatible with AI-proof jobs:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>From College as the Only Path to Success to Valuing Diverse Educational Paths</strong>: Recognize that trade schools can offer faster, more targeted training for in-demand skills that are less likely to be replaced by AI[1][4].</li>
<li><strong>From Emphasizing Academic Credentials to Appreciating Practical Skills</strong>: Shift focus from academic degrees to the practical skills and hands-on experience that trade jobs provide, which are crucial in an economy where AI handles more cognitive tasks[1][4].</li>
<li><strong>From Perceiving Manual Work as Less Prestigious to Recognizing Its Importance</strong>: Change the perception that manual or skilled trade work is less prestigious than white-collar jobs, understanding that these roles are essential and often offer stable employment[1][4].</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>By adjusting these attitudes, Gen Xers can better prepare themselves and future generations for a job market where AI and automation play significant roles. Encouraging a more inclusive view of what constitutes a successful and fulfilling career path can help align with the opportunities presented by AI-proof jobs.</p>

<p>This was quite succinct explanation of the Scientific Method&rsquo;s use and the obstacles human brains encounter when attempting to do so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientific method is how humans figure out how our universe works. Done correctly, it controls for the all-too-human mistakes people can make in figuring stuff out.</p>

<p>Using it, we can prune away false explanations for our universe&hellip;produced by falling prey to biases like these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirmation bias</li>
<li>Survivor bias</li>
<li>Observer bias</li>
<li>False pattern recognition</li>

<h2 id="high-heels">High Heels</h2>
<p>This past Friday, a few colleagues revisited an old argument. The argument? That high heels are safe to wear. This in spite of the fact that the person making the assertion suffers from plantar fasciitis, which results in great pain until the situation is remedied. Some might argue, sensible footwear that provides the foot proper support lessens or eliminates the pain of plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>From my own experience with plantar fasciitis (but not high heels!, let me be clear), I can make the argument that the right support, usually from a store like The Good Feet or Foot Solutions, DOES make a difference. Unfortunately, my colleague had a great amount of high heels in her closet. She didn&rsquo;t want high heels to be inadequate to the cause of dealing with her plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>To that end, I was presented with a recent study meant to sway my opinion in another direction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://wtmj.com/shows/wisconsins-morning-news/2024/02/26/high-heels-good-for-you/">Really? A new study says wearing high heels can be good for you</a></strong> High heels are the shoes everybody loves, but no one wants to wear. &ldquo;I think most people would (assume) wearing high heels is a bad idea&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I replied with a quote from Perplexity.ai:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientific consensus indicates that wearing high heels can lead to various biomechanical changes and adaptations, primarily affecting the foot-ankle complex, knee, and postural stability. These changes can result in increased ground reaction forces, altered plantar pressure distribution, and impaired balance. The effects of specific heel heights on women&rsquo;s biomechanics would benefit from further research.
High heels have been associated with musculoskeletal pain, hallux valgus, and first-party injuries, with the incidence of injuries almost doubling from 2002 to 2012.
Some studies suggest that wearing high heels with a heel height of 3.76 cm to 4.47 cm, using larger heel base supports, and employing total contact inserts can help decrease adverse effects and improve comfort. However, these findings are based on short-term research, and long-term effects are still not fully understood[1][2].

</ul>
<p>Short-term studies&hellip;this made me run the Wisconsin&rsquo;s Radio Station reported study through a critical thinking analysis, also AI-powered. I ran it through my mega prompt using Melanie Trecek-King&rsquo;s FLOATER acronym.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, while the study presents interesting findings, the small sample size and the specificity of the participant group suggest that the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research with a larger and more diverse group of participants would be necessary to confirm the study&rsquo;s conclusions and to understand the potential long-term effects of wearing high heels on walking efficiency and injury risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-we-think-is-true">What We Think Is True</h2>
<p>While taking notes last night, I ran across this quote about confirmation bias. I paraphrase it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we seek out information that supports what we already think is true, that is confirmation bias. (Source: Paraphased from Melanie Trecek-King)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this advice from Melanie to be spot on and tough to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine if belief is falsifiable.</li>
<li>If it is, actively look for evidence to prove yourself wrong. If belief is true, it will withstand scrutiny. If it is not true, evidence will disprove it.</li>
<li>Accept the evidence, and</li>
<li>Change your mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Easier said than done. I could replace high heels with any other number of wants and desires, things I wish were true but evidence shows them to not be. We all suffer from a desire to marshal information to support our beliefs, even when wrong.</p>
<p>Some times, they are true, and that&rsquo;s a nice feeling.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>Note: This is another book that really shifted my thinking and opened my eyes to the history of the United States. As an American citizen born abroad (Panama), I absorbed America&rsquo;s FALSE histories in private, Catholic school education. When the author of <em>Lies My Teacher Told Me</em> discusses the fake historical accounts in American high school textbooks, my textbooks appear in his list of false history proponents. So, much of my &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; had another think coming. I suspect many Americans are in the same boat, and today&rsquo;s political efforts by bigoted politicians clad in red hats is recognition of America waking up to the fact they&rsquo;ve been lied to all their lives. Clint Smith&rsquo;s work is heartbreaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I read different books on different devices, I found myself perusing Clint Smith&rsquo;s “<strong><em><a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/clint-smith/how-the-word-is-passed/9780316492935/#:~:text=A%20deeply%20researched%20and%20transporting,holidays%20such%20as%20Juneteenth%2C%20or">How the Word is Passed:A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America.&quot;</a></em></strong> I have avoided books about slavery. It is an unpleasant subject, but given my ignorance of the topic and it&rsquo;s relevance to social justice education and, ultimately, rediscovering cultural norms and ways others interact, I thought it might be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Of course, the quotes at the start of the book immediately hooked me. I am amazed at Frederick Douglass' words and quotes, and found this one to be gripping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our past was slavery. We cannot recur to it with any sense of complacency or composure. The history of it is as a record of stripes, a revelation of agony. It is written in characters of blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, the imagery in that portion of the quote is&hellip;incredible. I can imagine a slave being whipped, blood dripping from the cuts. I suppose my brain is connecting &ldquo;a record of stripes, a revelation of agony&rdquo; with the beating and whipping of Jesus before he was put on the cross to die. What an image of torture and misery. Of course, Douglass isn&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>Douglass goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its breath is a sigh, its voice a groan, and we turn from it with a shudder. The duty of to-day is to meet the question that confront us with intelligence and courage. -Frederick Douglass, &ldquo;The Nation&rsquo;s Problem&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slavery can&rsquo;t be remembered without an awareness of the agony that marks it. It is bloody, miserable, and we want to turn away from it, since it is so horrible, ugly, unpleasant. We can&rsquo;t allow this revulsion and the pain it causes our sensibilities to overwhelm us, though. We must face it with &ldquo;intelligence and courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I clean the dog&rsquo;s poop, engage in doing something that revolts me, I know it must be done because it is necessary. I cannot be put off by the task because the consequences of NOT doing it are worse than the act of dealing with something unpleasant.</p>
<p>Clint Smith&rsquo;s book is powerful. It begins with his visit to Monticello, where Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, owned human beings, kept and sold them to pay his debts. It tells the tale of Thomas Jefferson in his 40s taking a teenage human slave, Sally, and having five children with her.</p>
<h2 id="slavery-defined">Slavery Defined</h2>
<p>One of the tour guides in Clint&rsquo;s book says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slavery&rsquo;s an institution. In Jefferson' lifetime it becomes a system. So what is this slave system? It is a system of exploitation, a system of inequality and exclusion, a system where peopleare owned as property and held down by physical and psychological force, a system being justified even by people who know slavery is morally wrong. By doing what? Denying the very humanity of those who are enslaved solely on the basis of the color of their skin.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clint Smith observes, &ldquo;Having enslaved workers helped Jefferson maintain his lifestyle, by giving him the time and space to do what he cared about most: reading, writing, and hosting guests who came to visit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="history-and-nostalgia">History and Nostalgia</h2>
<p>Another quote that has caught my attention in the book?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you challenge people, specifically white people&rsquo;s conception of Jefferson, you&rsquo;re in fact challenging their conception of themselves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to realize that there&rsquo;s a difference between history and nostalgia, and somewhere between those two is memory,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I think that history is the story of the past, using all the available facts, and that nostalgia is a fantasy about the past using no facts, and somewhere in between is memory, which is kind of this blend of history and a little bit of emotion&hellip;I mean, history is kind of about what you need to know&hellip;but nostalgia is what you want to hear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of Greg Epstein&rsquo;s point again. Although he makes it from his perspective as humanist who does not believe in God, it&rsquo;s relevant here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most religion is not about an all-seeing deity with a baritone voice and a flowing beard. It is about group identification&ndash;the community and the connections we need to live. It is about family, tradition, consolation, ethics, memories, music, art, architecture, and much more. Outside traditional forms of religious affiliation or custom, it is hard to find these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, when our identities are tied up with our group, our community, our culture, history fades in importance, and nostalgia is all there is&hellip;a fantasy story of who you are, who you are with others who believe the lies, and how that is expressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still reading Clint Smith&rsquo;s book, and each bit of detail about history tears away a little of my own nostalgia, my own memories of what I was taught, each emotionally bound to who I was and when, where I learned it, and who I &ldquo;learned&rdquo; it with. The periphery of memories is powerful, even as the core of what was learned is rotten lies.</p>
<h2 id="mynotes">MyNotes</h2>
<p>This is a powerful book, and it has been incredibly difficult to read. Some quotes have jumped out at me, but you need the context of Clint&rsquo;s words. Some points stand apart, and I share a portion of those below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Race is a by-product of racism&hellip;.&ldquo;Racism is first and foremost a social practice, which means that it is an action and a rationale for action, or both at once. Racism always takes for granted the objective reality of race&hellip;so it is important to register their distinctness.The shorthand transforms racism, something an aggressor does, into race, something the target is, in a sleight of hand that is easy to miss.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Why didn&rsquo;t every enslaved person escape as Douglass, Tubman, and Jacobs had? Had they not tried hard enough? This is part of the insidiousness of white supremacy; it illuminates the exceptional in order to implicitly blame those who cannot, in the most brutal circumstances, attain superhuman heights.</li>
<li>It does this instead of blaming the system, the people who built it, the people who maintained it.</li>
<li>In overly mythologizing our ancestors, we forget an all-too-important reality: the vast majority were ordinary people, which is to say they were people just like everyone else. This ordinariness is only shameful when used to legitimize oppression This is its own quiet violence.</li>
<li>When enslaved women were raped by their enslaver, they were up against not only the physical power of the person enacting violence against them but also the power of the state, the power of patriarchy, the power of a society.</li>
<li>These acts were not only permissible but legally encouraged. There were laws stating that almost any crime committed against a white person against a Black person was in fact not a crime at all.</li>
<li>Oppression is never about humanity or lack thereof. It is, and always has been, about power.</li>
<li><strong>Discovered ignorance.</strong> It&rsquo;s a feeling of &ldquo;discovered ignorance. When you wonder, <em>How could this have happened and I didn&rsquo;t know about it? How could that happen?&quot;</em></li>
<li><strong>Texas' Confederate Declaration of Succession</strong>: &ldquo;We hold, as undeniable truths, that the governments of various States and of the Confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent [sic] race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable&rdquo;</li>
<li>Governor of Texas, Sam Houston, was removed from governorship of Texas by those wishing to join the Confederacy. Houston refused to swear an oath to the Confederacy, writing, &ldquo;In the name of my own conscience and manhood&hellip;I refuse to take this oath.&rdquo;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m left wondering if we are all just patchworks of the stories we&rsquo;ve been told.</li>
<li>What would it take&ndash;what does it take&ndash;for you to confront a false history even if it means shattering the stories you have been told throughout your life?</li>
<li>Even if it means having to fundamentally reexamine who you are and who your family has been?</li>
<li>Just because something is difficult to accept doesn&rsquo;t mean you should refuse to accept it. Just because someone tells you a story doesn&rsquo;t make that story true.</li>
<li>She wanted them to understand that their ancestry, their history, did not begin with&hellip;chains. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want them to think, <em>Oh, we popped up and we became enslaved.</em> No, we were thriving communities and nations and did amazing things before we were ever found by the white man. We did so many things that it didn&rsquo;t mean that we came here dumb and we had to learn somebody else&rsquo;s way to become truly educated and actualized. I wanted them to see what they brought to the table, and to try to maintain and preserve who they are, and not think that in order to be successful, I have to let go of my cultural stuff and adopt somebody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>There has been so much history shared in Clint Smith that as I approach the end of the text, it&rsquo;s overwhelming. The evidence for slavery, for a system that engineered slavery into the very foundations of the United States of America is unavoidable. One of the points that Clint Smith makes sure to pass on is this quote from Damaras, a tour guide of enslaved places and where slavery happened in New York city:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for being uncomfortable with me&hellip;If there&rsquo;s anything I can leave you with, <strong>question everything.</strong> Myself, everything you read, everything you hear. <strong>Fact-check, fact-check, fact-check</strong>.
<strong>Don&rsquo;t believe anything if it makes you comfortable</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Damaras, and Clint Smith, sure make the case for teaching critical thinking skills, right?</p>
<p>Some other quotes that jump out at me, that are certainly relevant to educators:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;&hellip;one has to tread very carefully in the dissemination of that alternative interpretation, because to do so I think actually bears the ethical responsibility of relationship building. If you&rsquo;re going to purport to tell the history of a place, you need to have relationships of trust in that place&hellip;that&rsquo;s a fundamental operational commitment.&rdquo; (Nelson, quoted excerpt from Clint Smith&rsquo;s version)</li>
<li>Slavery took a toll on West Africa&rsquo;s population: <strong>millions</strong> of people were stripped from their homelands and sent across the ocean to serve in intergenerational bondage. The profound harm continued during colonialism</li>
</ul>

			 <p>&ldquo;Sure, have a bite, Adam, it&rsquo;s OK to eat,&rdquo; said the fantastical character, Eve, in that book all of us have read at some point or another.

<p>Wow, what a powerful insight. If deep culture comes to us as children, then it&rsquo;s worth taking a hard look at your history, your culture, your religious beliefs. At least, it seems like an obvious connection to me.</p>

<h2 id="whose-fault-is-it-anyway">Whose Fault Is It, Anyway?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down,&rdquo; says Isabel Allende.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She&rsquo;s quoted in a book I just read (<strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/09/mynotes-cassandra-speaks.html">see my notes here</a></strong>).  We see it everywhere. Why?</p>
<p>When I cracked open Elizabeth Lesser&rsquo;s book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cassandra-Speaks-Women-Storytellers-Changes/dp/0062887181">Cassandra Speaks</a>,</em> I was appalled at the collection of quotes that consistently paint women as bad folk to be around, that lie, seduce, and are to blame for everything in a man&rsquo;s life. Men blame women for so much, and these stories have crept into every relationship people have with each other, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>Of course, reading this book while watching the evening news, the <strong><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2021/09/21/28810">Taliban&rsquo;s treatment of their countrywomen</a></strong>, I couldn&rsquo;t help but see Lesser&rsquo;s words playing out again and again with <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/17/uk-violence-against-women-police-report/">every bit of news</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In her book, <em>Cassandra Speaks</em>, Lesser quotes Polly Young-Eisendrath:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Both Eve and Pandora bring death into the world. This is a curious reversal of the fact that women bring life into the world, but it says something about the meaning of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; within a religion dominated by male gods.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lesser points out in many places where Judeo-Christian tradition is patriarchal, and exclusionary of women. If only exclusion were all there was to it, it is downright critical.</p>
<h2 id="false-stories">False Stories</h2>
<p>The story of Old Testament paradise, a man-made creation according to any <strong><a href="https://www.thejc.com/judaism/books/the-chief-rabbi-on-genesis-1.12309">Jewish rabbi you may speak to</a></strong> rather than the literal account of how things came to be, is one that has many problems with it. As Greg Epstein pointed out in his book, <strong><em><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/search/label/Humanism">Good Without God</a></em></strong>, the problem is that we started at paradise and then went downhill from there.</p>
<p>In what I found to be quite humorous, Epstein points out that the &ldquo;Humpty Dumpty&rdquo; perspective is problematic. He outlines it in his book, and <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/09/mynotes-exploring-humanism-chapter-4-6.html">here are the relevant part I noted in this blog entry</a></strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Humpty Dumpty mentality says that the world</strong>&ndash;be it our personal lives or society as a whole or whatever&ndash;<strong>needs to be repaired</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Things were once perfect</strong> and round and bright and shiny like an egg <strong>until they fell and broke into a million piece</strong>s, and now it&rsquo;s our job to reassemble all the pieces.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, they didn&rsquo;t simply FALL down, right? The Garden of Eden didn&rsquo;t fall off a wall and break. Rather, it was Eve who brought it all crashing down. And this insidious lie based on a fantasy has framed every single relationship, every interaction between men and women who believe.</p>
<p>In this story, Elizabeth Lesser points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So many stories impart the same themes: Men are the morally pure and noble. Women are the ones who succumb to evil and tempt the man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She cites quite a few examples, making this a must-read book for every woman, and the book should be mandatory reading for all men, especially believers. She points out that as we become more &ldquo;familiar with our culture&rsquo;s origin stories and trace their influence,&rdquo; the process serves as an effective way to take stock of our lives. Uh, it&rsquo;s a bit more earth-shattering than that.</p>
<p>Greg Epstein points out that &ldquo;there was never, ever, at any point in our lives or in human history, a perfect egg of goodness to shatter.&rdquo; But this is what happens and is playing out every day in the news.</p>
<p>Ceasing to believe in God or religion becomes a truly meaningful, worthwhile position when it also means ceasing to live in the past. We move on. We focus not on who wronged us, but on what we can do, what we can build, how we can grow, to make our lives better.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Lesser suggests these stories &ldquo;<strong>tell false and destructive narratives</strong> <strong>about</strong> women and men, femininity and masculinity, and <strong>the nature and purpose of life</strong>.&rdquo; Epstein points this out as well, encouraging us to not focus on the past, to move on.</p>
<p>Once you know stories are&hellip;well, fictional&hellip;then you can say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to learn that lesson. Or I have a choice about how to move forward, even as I leave behind all the baggage of a complicated narrative that is heavily one-sided (patriarchal).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equity is &ldquo;reducing the predictability of who succeeds and who fails, interruptive reproductive practices that negatively impact struggling students of color, and cultivating the unique gifts and talents of every student,&rdquo; according to the <strong><a href="https://www.nationalequityproject.org/education-equity-definition">National Equity Project</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you tell fake stories, lies in other words, that denigrate part of humanity (e.g. girls/women, people of color), can you achieve equity? Lesser certainly suggests that we can achieve a fresh perspective on an old challenge. She says that &ldquo;Women must become protagonists in the stories that shape the world.&rdquo; What does that look like? Maybe like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), women contribute more than 50 percent of food produced globally and make up over 40 percent of the agricultural labour force. But while women keep families fed and nourished, they are disadvantaged in accessing critical resources for food production compared to men. They lack access to land, inputs, extension, banking and financial services.</p>
<p>“Until we end the discrimination of women around the globe, I doubt these things will change even though women are in the largest part of the world’s food producers,” said Nierenberg, who co-founded and now heads the global food systems think tank, Food Tank.

<h2 id="lies-my-teacher-told-me">Lies My Teacher Told Me</h2>
<p>If my Sunday school teacher told me lies, what about my public school teacher? Oh, that&rsquo;s right, I went to private school for K-12, so it&rsquo;s pretty much of a &ldquo;Question everything&rdquo; kind of experience. Whether public or private school, if you studied history out of a textbook, then you were lied to.</p>
<p>I now understand why my history teachers, especially those in high school, often were bitter or spent time &ldquo;birdwalking,&rdquo; that venerable practice of speaking about their life adventures while purporting to cover the material. Brother McCarthy at Central Catholic High School told about his experiences in Peru (making him one of my favorite teachers, but not for his lessons of history).</p>
<p>Brother Schnitzer (who wore alligator skin boots and guayaberas) delighted in sharing biting insights and brilliant commentary. Now, I realize both were letting us consume a load of lies.</p>
<p>This is driven home when I read a book like James W. Loewen&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/0743296281">Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong</a></em>. Consider that in all twelve textbooks reviewed (one of them being the one I practically inhaled, analyzed, memorized, regurgitated to get 100s on countless quizzes on) the following is never shared:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://time.com/5918660/helen-keller-disability-history/">Helen Keller was a radical socialist</a></strong>. I had no clue. I even watched the documentary on Helen Keller. I had no idea she wrote books, marched, and supported socialism.</li>
<li>President Woodrow Wilson was a white supremacist. Wait, what? He was prejudiced against Blacks, and put into effect a variety of policies and programs to hurt various peoples. After reading what Loewen had to say about Wilson, which was excluded, my perspective changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was shocked at reading this. Is it my teachers' fault I didn&rsquo;t follow-up as an adult and question everything, research it all, more? Does the canard, &ldquo;I was raising a family and working on my career&rdquo; let me off the hook? Probably not.</p>
<p>In the book, <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-loewen-dead/2021/08/20/ed1af032-0226-11ec-a664-4f6de3e17ff0_story.html">James W. Loewen</a></strong> (he passed away August 19, 2021) points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I began with Helen Keller because omitting the last sixty-four years of her life exemplifies the sort of culture-serving distortion that will be discussed later in this book. We teach Keller as an ideal, not a real person, to inspire our young people to emulate her. Keller becomes a mythic figure, the &ldquo;woman who overcame&rdquo; but for what? There is no content!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consistent with our American ideolog of individualism, the truncated version of Helen Keller&rsquo;s story sanitizes a hero, leaving only the virtues of self-help and hard work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keller herself, while scarcely opposing hard work, explicitly reject this ideology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of what I read of Helen Keller, my perspective changed as well. In either case, I found myself saying, &ldquo;What a bunch of lies I was fed in American high school.&rdquo; You have hope that historians will be truth tellers, but no such hope for textbook publishers and teachers forced to lie to the next generation.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="forget-the-alamo">Forget the Alamo</h2>
<p>Can we have hope that &ldquo;Remember the Alamo&rdquo; monuments will stand untarnished,  a fierce beacon for Texas' fight for independence, freedom? Well, not quite. In their book, <strong><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forget-Alamo-Rise-Fall-American/dp/1984880098">Forget the Alamo</a></em></strong>, a book I am only now beginning, the authors assert several points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was about upholding slavery, not freedom</li>
<li>Mexican allies were written out of Texas history, an act of ethnic cleansing</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mexican American kids can grow up in Texas believing they&rsquo;re Americans, with the Statue of Liberty and all that, until seventh grade when you were taught, in essence, that if you&rsquo;re Mexican, your ancestors killed Davy Crockett, that that&rsquo;s kind of the original sin of the Texas creation myth. It has been used just anecdotally for generations to put down Mexican Americans, a big beefy white guy going up to the little Mexican guy and punching him in the arm and saying, &ldquo;Remember the Alamo,&rdquo; that type of thing. (<strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/16/1006907140/forget-the-alamo-texas-history-bryan-burrough">source</a></strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone with dual citizenship, United States through my father, an American of Swedish descent who fought in the Korean Conflict and Panama via my mother, a secondary mathematics school teacher, I have always been grateful for my heritage.</p>
<p>What I am less grateful for is the LIES taught to me in school, in church, and I just don&rsquo;t get it. Why not accept the events as they happened, learn from them, and do better? I suspect this is a naive perspective. Lying about what happened enables those in power to perpetuate their reign, to subjugate others.</p>
<p>Consider Dr. Loewen&rsquo;s point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Telling the truth about the past helps cause justice in the present</strong>,” was his guiding principle, he wrote. “Achieving justice in the present helps us tell the truth about the past.” (<strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-loewen-dead/2021/08/20/ed1af032-0226-11ec-a664-4f6de3e17ff0_story.html">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you consider Texas history, American history, religious history favoring a particular perspective through these lenses, one may get the feeling that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice. My first inkling (yeah, I feel naive, stupid) that there were deep, serious problems I was unaware of due to my transplanted status (Panama to Texas) was <strong>The Son</strong><em>,</em> a drama series. Consider this quote about and you&rsquo;ll know exactly how I feel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know much about Texas when I moved there for graduate school. In my first or second semester, I took a class in life and literature of the Southwest, and that&rsquo;s where I first heard about these events along the border in 1915-1918, what Anglos called the Bandit Wars. It involved a series of attacks on ranches and infrastructure that were basically minor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of those attacks was a long series of massacres of Mexican-Americans, or tejanos, all along the Texas border from Brownsville up to West Texas. <strong>It was a major part of Texas history… and I&rsquo;d never heard of it.</strong> And that was the seed of the first part of the book.

</blockquote>
<p>Makes you think, doesn&rsquo;t it? The truth is all around, but you can be blind to it. And, when your eyes are opened, things fall apart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the stories that have glued together a culture lose their potency, things begin to fall apart. But new things rise up. (Source: Elizabeth Lesser, Cassandra Speaks)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fable-factory-from-murderers-to-heroes-liars-to-truthtellers">Fable Factory: From Murderers to Heroes, Liars to Truthtellers</h2>
<p>When the glue that holds a culture together loses its potency, all hell breaks loose. Would that be a fair description of what&rsquo;s been happening lately? And, that socio-cultural war over whose story is right is headed for our schools. It&rsquo;s in our schools now. Once you know the truth, you can&rsquo;t perpetuate a hoax. Once you know that John Wayne made racist remarks, President Woodrow Wilson was a racist, that Helen Keller was a socialist, that Texas Rangers were a hit squad for runaway slaves, Mexicans, and Mexican-Americans, my goodness, you can&rsquo;t un see the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heroism and exploits of the Rangers have been portrayed for decades in Broadway plays, dime-store novels, radio dramas and movies and TV shows, most notably &ldquo;The Lone Ranger.&rdquo; But in the five years he spent researching the Rangers, Swanson also found a dark side to their story. They burned villages and slaughtered innocents. They committed war crimes, hunted runaway slaves and murdered so many Mexicans and Mexican Americans that they were as feared on the Mexican border as the Ku Klux Klan was in the Deep South. Throughout it all, Swanson writes, <strong>the Rangers operated a fable factory to burnish their image as heroic defenders of the innocent.</strong> (source: <strong><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0818ZGD74/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Cult of Glory: The Bold and Brutal History of the Texas Rangers</a></em></strong>, as <strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/08/871929844/cult-of-glory-reveals-the-dark-history-of-the-texas-rangers">cited in NPR</a></strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote, this perspective of &ldquo;fable factory,&rdquo; matches, doesn&rsquo;t it? Throughout time, people have been lying and perpetuating lies about how we came to be, what happened, and using those stories to subjugate others.</p>
<p>These stories paint half the human experience (women) in the worst possible way. They offered the opportunity for growth and redemption, but again and again, most chose to tell the story of humiliation and subjugation. It all began a long time ago and continues today.</p>
<h2 id="toxic-positivity-the-garden-of-eden">Toxic positivity: The Garden of Eden?</h2>
<p>When I first read about toxic positivity, against the backdrop of history&rsquo;s gruesome visage, I have to tell you, I saw immediate connections. Let&rsquo;s review what toxic positivity is, shall we? According to <strong><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/toxic-positivity">Medical News Today</a></strong>, it is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toxic positivity is an obsession with positive thinking. It is the belief that people should put a positive spin on all experiences, even those that are profoundly tragic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was reading about toxic positivity, in light of culturally responsive teaching (CRT), I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;What has history taught us?&rdquo; The truth is, history has taught us that people lie. They&rsquo;ve been telling big whoppers from the beginning, all the way back to Genesis. In a simple way, the story of paradise is one of toxic positivity that disenfranchises women in a horrible way.</p>
<p>How can we embrace culture of all, when so much of our own is based on lies about oppressing the other(s)? Oppressing ourselves?</p>
<h2 id="culturally-responsive-teaching">Culturally Responsive Teaching</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question. I do know that a desire to learn more about culturally responsive teaching has made me ask, &ldquo;What about history? What about my beliefs and values?&rdquo; And, at a time in my life when I can finally examine the truth, I am simply appalled at my own ignorance, at the lies, and worst of all, the injustice. Doing a self-audit is exactly <strong><a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/getting-started-culturally-responsive-teaching">what Edutopia recommends</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in being culturally responsive is to do an internal audit—yes, you read that right, an audit: truly digging deep inside of ourselves and recognizing and naming those things we don’t want to look at or talk about. The experiences we’ve had along our journey in life have formed stereotypes which have then turned into implicit bias. These unintentional, unconscious attitudes impact how we relate to our students and their parents, and how we choose curriculum, assess learning, and plan lessons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is important because, and this is the part I choke on every time I read it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culturally responsive teachers also have to be aware of the <strong>sociopolitical context</strong> schools operate in and dare to go against that status quo. Students need to understand the system that is working around them in schools. Give them context and don’t be afraid to talk about the tough subjects that may not be addressed in your school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unbelievably, sociopolitical context is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sociopolitical context refers to contemporary ideologies, regulations, policies, conditions, laws, practices, traditions, and events that define America&rsquo;s education. &hellip; The sociopolitical context affects every society due to the connection between democracy and public schools&hellip;At an individual level, teachers, school leaders, and other educators are largely influenced by the ideologies and beliefs in society. They act on them whether they believe them or not. Racism and other biases manifest themselves through school policies and through school staff practices and decisions. (<strong><a href="https://www.theedadvocate.org/deciphering-the-sociopolitical-context-of-school-reform/">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you see that? Ideologies, traditions, laws, practices. And, then you have only to consider how America, how Texas, perception of past events has been challenged, how current government has responded.</p>
<p>I suspect my next book will be Zaretta Hammond&rsquo;s <em>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain</em>. In the meantime, <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2kzbH7ZWGg">check out this video</a></strong> as a way to clarify some of the points.</p>

<p>One of Alexa&rsquo;s annoying attributes is not responding to a question that involves products from other vendors. If it&rsquo;s not Amazon or Amazon Prime, I&rsquo;m less likely to get a response. If the question is judged as politically incorrect, Alexa will defer its response or avoid the question altogether.</p>
<p>Worse, Alexa is now answering questions I haven&rsquo;t asked, or is unable to process the detail of my question as an internet search that yields results. For the first time in a long time, I considered throwing my Alexa Echo dots in the trash.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="siris-sappy-solicitude">Siri&rsquo;s Sappy Solicitude</h2>
<p>Where Alexa refuses to answer questions, Siri is quick to respond but then provides a list of links or web searches. Often, I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with the quality of the response. These days, I&rsquo;m more likely to just do the web search myself than depend on Siri to serve as my intermediary.</p>
<p>When will these two get their act together? Both are promising change:</p>

<p>While reading my twitter feed one evening (or was it early morning), I stumbled upon a book reference for Elizabeth Lesser&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082T1Z8YG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Cassandra Speaks</a></em>.

In fact, I&rsquo;ve recommended it to everyone I&rsquo;ve spoken to in the last few days.</p>
<p>This blog entry includes some of <strong>My Notes</strong> that I wrote in my notepad. I put them here so I won&rsquo;t lose them and hope you will also be intrigued.</p>
<h2 id="mynotes">MyNotes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Women know something that the world needs now. We know it in our bones. We&rsquo;ve always known it.</li>
<li>The stories that people have been absorbing for centuries&hellip;stories that tell false and destructive narratives about women and men, femininity and masculinity, and the nature and purpose of life.</li>
<li>Eve: &ldquo;Second in creation, first to sin.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Cassandra&rsquo;s story is that of every woman who has been dismissed, gaslighted, or punished for having an opinion of her own.</li>
<li>When the stories that have glued together a culture lose their potency, things begin to fall apart. But new things rise up.</li>
<li>Turmoil and backlash ensue, but so do big leaps forward.</li>
<li>We are living in a time when the stories that have provided meaning and structure for Western customs and institutions are being challenged.</li>
<li>Some of those stories are beautifu, instructive, and worth saving. But many of our foundational narratives that pretend to be about and for all of us were told by only a few of us, and therefore have served a mere slice of humanity.</li>
<li>They have set in store which values and temperments should prevail, what power looks like, and who gets to have it.</li>
<li>Stories for men or patriarchy:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>stoicism</li>
<li>warriorship</li>
<li>violence</li>

<li>&ldquo;History isn&rsquo;t what happened, it&rsquo;s who tells the story.&rdquo; -Sally Roesch Wagner</li>
<li>Stories endure. They outlive the people who tell them, they jump from one continent to another, they continue to mold cultures for generations.</li>
<li>Becoming famliar with our culture&rsquo;s origin stories and tracing their influence is an effective way to take stock of our lives and to claim an authentically powerful voice.</li>
<li>Many creation myths from earlier ancestors painted a different picture of the origin of women and men and their worth and roles.</li>
<li>In many of those stories, neithr sex was created to dominate the other. Both men and women shared the responsibility to help the community survive, thrive, and connect with the sacred. These are not the stories most of were raised on.</li>
<li>So many stories impart the same themes:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>men are th emorally pure and noble</li>
<li>women are the ones who succumb to evil and tempt the man</li>
</ul>
<ol start="20">
<li>To grow up is to admit that life is challenging and that we are responsible for our own behavior and for the well-being of one another</li>
<li>To be human often feels as if we arrived here without an instruction book, longing for direction</li>
<li>We are lost, but can be found. We suffer but can grow wise. We can learn how things really work, and chart a noble path home.</li>
<li>Our tasks is to become like gods&ndash;self-aware and responsible for choosing goodness over evil.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.&rdquo; T.S. Eliot</li>
<li>Both Eve and Pandora bring death into the world. This is a curious reversal of the fact that women bring life into the world, but it says something about the meaning of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; within a religion dominated by male gods. - Polly Young-Eisendrath</li>
<li>Archaeologists, paleontologists, and anthropologists have been studying prehistoric cultures and peoples. They are trying to piece together, not only stories we have never heard but also the ways in which the scribes of history have rewritten reality to fit into their prevailing worldviews.</li>
<li>Pandora means &lsquo;all-giving&rsquo;. Elpis is the spirit of hope</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s time to tell stories where no one is to blame for the human predicament and all of us are responsible for forging a hopeful path forward.</li>
<li>&ldquo;God has no gender because there is no God.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sophia is Wisdom (in Sirach)</li>
<li>&ldquo;The hardest times for me were not when people challenged what I said, but when my voice was not heard.&rdquo; -Carol Gilligan</li>
<li>It is a great story, but it is a story about male conflict, male dilemma, male struggle&hellip;we have to be prepared to go back through all our books, films&hellip;and say, this is written by a male artist, not an artist. - Jude Kelley</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.&rdquo; Jose Ortega y Gassett</li>
<li>Who chose violent conflict as the one human activity to laud over all others? Deny evil the attention it seeks.</li>
<li>Women created most of the oldest known cave art paintings suggests an analysis of ancient handprints - Dean Snow, Penn State archaeologist</li>
<li>History is often a distorted window into the past, the perspective of those with the power to tell it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If women are not perceived to be fully within the structures of power, surely, it is power that we need to redefine rather than women&rdquo; -Mary Beard</li>
<li>Basic assumptions about power that women must question:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Domination and violence are necessary to maintain order</li>
<li>Men are divinely or biologically predetermined to lead</li>
<li>The strong/silent warrior is to be revered while the emotional communicative caretaker is second rate</li>
</ul>
<ol start="39">
<li>Women must become protagonists in the stories that shape the world</li>
<li>The single story of power&ndash;the excess of one value system and the exclusion of others&ndash;has left humanity in a bind.</li>
<li>Women have internalized patriarchy and created unhealthy coping mechanisms to survive and prosper.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whoever fights monsters, should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster.&rdquo; Friedrich Nietsche</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Over the years, I&rsquo;ve interviewed thousands of people&hellip;and I would say that the root of every dysfunction, every problem I&rsquo;ve encountered, has been some sense of a lacking of self-value or self-worth.&rdquo;</p>

<ol start="56">
<li>New stories and more authentic values are inside of us, in the depths of who we really are, beneath the usual brain chatter, under the conditioning or confusion or fear that holds us back.</li>
<li>&ldquo;You are the sky. Everything else&ndash;it&rsquo;s just the weather.&rdquo; Pema Chodron</li>
<li>All too often our so-called strength comes from fear, not love.</li>

<p>What an inspiring book to read, full of quotes like the ones above. What the author, Elizabeth Lesser, does with each quote is expand upon it, often using it as the grain of sand to build a pearl of life experiences and insights around it. I highly recommend the book, not only because it&rsquo;s eye-opening, illusion-banishing in a way that&rsquo;s the same but distinct from Greg Epstein&rsquo;s book, and because it offers a different path forward.</p>

<p>As powerful, useful, and helpful as AI is, my thoughts are divided as to introducing it to K-12 students. It may be hypocritical to say teachers should use it, but withhold it from students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 9 in 10 educators feel that students should be taught how AI works in a developmentally appropriate manner sometime before they graduate from high school, according to the survey.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Six percent of educators say that the topic shouldn’t be taught until the postsecondary levels and another 6 percent say that AI should never be taught. Most—65 percent—say it should be introduced to students in middle or high school.

			 <p>Earlier this year (2024), I found myself looking at my print notebooks, aghast. How ugly my print writing is! If you&rsquo;ve ever had to read my print, you&rsquo;ll find it nigh illegible. Of course, chances are, if you saw my cursive, you&rsquo;d think I was a doctor. At that moment, I made a decision. I would learn cursive again as an adult. And, I would use it. But how do you learn something you should have learned as a child?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="cursive-again">Cursive, Again</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I had probably the worst handwriting and practicing it over and over seemed to just make it worse. The class was done with ink and not pencil which added a whole different level of frustration,&rdquo; says Doug Peterson at <strong><a href="https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2024/03/03/whatever-happened-to-407/">Off the Record</a></strong>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not alone, Doug! Writing in cursive was a pain as a child, demanding a level of patience I was ill-equipped to provide as an outdoorsy kid with a safe environment (Los Rios, Canal Zone) to roam and jungle to explore.</p>
<p>That question nags at me, though. Could I learn cursive as an adult? It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;d suffered a debilitating injury or anything, having to relearn how to walk again or lift a spoon to my lips. Surely, I could learn.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="a-matter-of-discipline">A Matter of Discipline</h2>
<p>In the image above, which I&rsquo;m sure I snagged off Facebook from someone&rsquo;s share, there&rsquo;s a list of fascinating paradoxes. Number three is appropriate for this situation, although I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s intended for something else. It&rsquo;s the pain of discipline over the pain of regret.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s not a LOT of regret in failing to learn cursive&hellip;no where close to what one might experience what my father experienced as a tobacco/cigar smoker from the age of 18 until his 50s.</p>
<p>For him, regret took the form of lung cancer. Knowing that you could have gotten off the path that led to pain, if only you had paid MORE attention.</p>
<p>For those who eat their way into an early grave through a myriad of conditions, there&rsquo;s a lot of regret and self-recrimination. I know, I&rsquo;ve been doing my best to claw my way back from the edge of lifelong illness, trying to make up for a lifetime of eating well.</p>
<p>Through it all, I&rsquo;ve learned a powerful lesson. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you don&rsquo;t make little changes along the way, course corrections if you will, you will be forced to make radical change (that may fail) at the end<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a truism that I keep in mind as I spend two hours on my stepper a night, if not more to stay ahead of my co-workers who are also walking their way to better health. It pushes me to read more books, take better notes.</p>
<p>The regret of not learning cursive, well, that&rsquo;s not such a big thing compared to that commercial where the smoker says, &ldquo;The biggest lies are the ones you tell yourself.&rdquo; Obviously, it&rsquo;s important to slow down and measure every act you take.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-the-evidence">Where&rsquo;s the Evidence?</h2>
<p>Some of the studies I&rsquo;ve read on handwritten notes definitely point towards big benefits. The problem is, you get those benefits whether your handwriting is print or cursive.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s nothing special about cursive, as far as I can tell. I&rsquo;ve <strong><a href="https://blog.tcea.org/note-taking-and-outlining/">written about generative note-taking</a> (or note-taking by hand) before</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The students who were taking longhand notes in our studies had to be more selective. You can’t write as fast as you can type. And that extra processing of the material that they were doing benefited them.”

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, wait, I&rsquo;ve got another think coming about this. Apparently, there&rsquo;s a update on this from California, where they&rsquo;ve made a big decision:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the start of 2024, the state of California reinstated the requirement that first through sixth graders in public schools learn to write in cursive&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>California re-joins nearly two dozen US states that have made cursive education mandatory in some form. California-based neuroscientist Claudia Aguirre says &ldquo;more and more neuroscience research is supporting the idea that writing out letters in cursive, especially in comparison to typewriting, can activate specific neural pathways that facilitate and optimise overall learning and language development.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kelsey Voltz-Poremba, assistant professor of occupational therapy at the University of Pittsburgh, adds that young children may even find cursive easier to learn and replicate. &ldquo;When handwriting is more autonomous for a child, it allows them to put more cognitive energy towards more advanced visual-motor skills and have better learning outcomes,&rdquo; she says. <strong>Source: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240122-california-signs-cursive-writing-into-law-what-are-the-brain-benefits">BBC.com</a></strong></p>

<p>The main benefits of writing by hand are that your brain is more active than when typing. When you compare writing by hand to typewritten notes, the winner is always writing by hand.</p>
<p>And, as I said earlier, the benefits accrue whether you are writing in print or cursive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the greatest benefits (to <strong><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/154193120905302218">memory</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8222525/">learning words</a></strong>, for example) are tied to the act of writing itself, not cursive over print. (**Source: As cited in the BBC article</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is learning cursive merely an affectation? I know how to print, after all. Do I really need to put in hours of effort to learn how to write in cursive?</p>
<h2 id="stoking-the-flames-of-creativity">Stoking the Flames of Creativity</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Writing in a new medium encourages creativity,&rdquo; I thought to myself as I worked on my micro blog.</p>
<p>I had to remind myself that setting up a new blog is a pain in the neck, especially when you are trying to apply what you have learned and done in the past to a new situation.</p>
<p>Far better to start fresh, and begin anew. Consider this quote that discusses getting out of your rut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By switching up the medium in which you write, you&rsquo;re able to challenge yourself in new ways and expand your creativity. (<strong><a href="https://aicontentfy.com/en/blog/benefits-of-writing-for-different-mediums-and-genres">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and I did learn cursive again. Too much fun writing notes in cursive. Takes forever</p>
<p>Or, to go back to Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s work, often quoted to me back in my graduate school days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology. (Source: Marshall McLuhan)</p>

<p>Writing my blog entries in markdown has been a lot of fun. It&rsquo;s a space where formatting tools and Google&rsquo;s way of doing things in Blogger doesn&rsquo;t get in my way (it was after some of their recent &ldquo;updates&rdquo;). I suspect that writing in cursive will force my brain to engage in different ways. I already know handwriting in print has made long-term information retention better than typing (I do a lot of both). If cursive makes that handwriting more legible, and doesn&rsquo;t detract from the benefits of generative note-taking, well, that&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<h2 id="learning-more-about-cursive">Learning More About Cursive</h2>
<p>How does one learn cursive as an adult? I decided to ask my Perplexity AI Pro to see what it would say. I want you to know that I&rsquo;ve already put these results to the test. They work!</p>
<p>Here are the suggestions from the AI:</p>
<h3 id="ais-response">AI&rsquo;s Response</h3>
<p>Learning cursive as an adult can be achieved through a combination of online resources, practice, and consistency. Here are some steps to guide you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with the basics</strong>: Begin by learning the cursive alphabet. Websites like RoomRecess[2], SuryasCursive[6], and CursiveLetters[8] offer free practice sheets for each letter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use online courses and tutorials</strong>: Websites like ConsistentCursive[7], MyCursive[5], and ThePostmansKnock[11] offer free online courses and video tutorials. These resources provide step-by-step instructions and demonstrations on how to write each letter and connect them to form words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice regularly</strong>: Consistency is key when learning a new skill. Aim to practice for at least 20 minutes every day[4][10]. You can use printable practice sheets from websites like CentennialCollege Library Guides[3] and SuryasCursive[6].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use workbooks</strong>: Workbooks can provide structured and progressive practice. The &ldquo;Cursive Handwriting Workbook for Adults&rdquo; available on Amazon offers exercises around intriguing science facts, making practice more engaging[12].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Join online communities</strong>: Online communities have threads dedicated to handwriting improvement where you can share your progress, get feedback, and learn from others[1][9].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incorporate cursive into daily life</strong>: Once you&rsquo;re comfortable with individual letters, start incorporating cursive writing into your daily life. Write shopping lists, notes, or journal entries in cursive to get more practice[10].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, learning cursive is a process and your handwriting will improve with time and practice. Don&rsquo;t rush, take your time to write beautifully, and avoid pressing too hard when writing[4].</p>

<p>It may be this change doesn&rsquo;t do anything, but my goal? To take notes in one of my fancy notebooks in cursive. Isn&rsquo;t it silly? In the big scheme of things, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. Except, maybe it is&hellip;when I actually did, it was wonderful. Who knew writing in cursive could be so much fun? My younger self did not. Now that I&rsquo;m old and enjoy indoor activities like writing in cursive, I do.</p>

			 <p>Publishing your own work can be difficult, not that I&rsquo;d know. I&rsquo;ve read the story from others going through the ordeal several times. <strong><a href="https://www.jonathanmoeller.com/writer/">Jonathan Moeller</a></strong>, one of my favorite authors (I own all his books, so yeah, favorite), has detailed the process and the benefits. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;end of March (2023) I had also reached 2 million ebooks sold. Twelve years! That’s a long time. That’s honestly the longest consecutive time I’ve ever done anything. The longest traditional job I’ve ever held was for ten and a half years. Like, in the US, you can only be president for a maximum of eight years (barring a technicality with a vice president who becomes president and then is reelected twice), and I think only six(?) UK Prime Ministers have held the office for longer than twelve years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two million ebooks is also a staggering figure. (<strong><a href="https://www.jonathanmoeller.com/writer/?p=16383">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love sword and sorcery stuff, Moeller&rsquo;s writing is the best, especially The Grey Knight series. I LOVE it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Guy (name pronounced the way you&rsquo;d say the &ldquo;gui&rdquo; in guillotine) LeCharles Gonzalez agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authors who are able to think like entrepreneurs, diversify their income sources, and build effective support teams are the ones with the best shot at a long-term sustainable career. (<strong>Source: <a href="https://loudpoet.com/2018/10/02/get-a-cluetrain-sustainable-digital-strategy-for-author-platforms/">As in guillotine blog</a></strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the basics of every author&rsquo;s platform? Guy suggests that it should be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A website</li>
<li>A dedicated email account</li>
<li>A social media account</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that big tech and business is working at undercutting these basics, or at least, ensuring that you rely on them to get that work done. I can&rsquo;t complain, I&rsquo;ve scattered my creative work across multiple sites and platforms. Rather than try to concentrate it on one, I figured something might survive over the long run.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not selling anything. I&rsquo;m not trying to make money, or monetize my work. My family says, &ldquo;You should write a book. You like to write.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the same reason people told me to get a doctorate&hellip;&ldquo;You like to write, Miguel.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore. It&rsquo;s not writing to make money. This may be just a dude staring into space, talking to himself&hellip;not to sell tickets to the obvious, but hoping somebody far away will respond.</p>

			 <p>Every few years, I revisit or reshare the list article. The reason why is simple. I don&rsquo;t want to lose a reminder of how I got my start in publishing my writing. But there are other formulas for writing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-power-of-a-formula">The Power of a Formula</h2>
<p>If you start out with a blank page, writing can be hard. But if you&rsquo;re following a formula, you&rsquo;re filling in the empty spots with words. When you&rsquo;re done, you edit and revise until you have something. Would it help to get an example?</p>
<h2 id="an-example-writing-strategies">An Example: Writing Strategies</h2>
<p>One project I am up to my nose in (think quicksand) right now is, &ldquo;Write something about writing strategies.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s my angle? How do you start something like that? For fun, here&rsquo;s my 10-second outline of what I&rsquo;m going to write:</p>
<ol>
<li>Problem statement that captures what the issue is</li>
<li>[Optional: Say, &ldquo;Before we get into what we can do about that, let&rsquo;s take a look at the research behind that.&rdquo; Then you explore research findings, etc.]</li>
<li>Three to Five subheadings, a few words each, that describe the strategy (an aspect of the solution) to the problem</li>
<li>Include an image that captures the essence of each subheading, or a short video clip</li>
<li>Finish with a quick concluding thought or recommendation</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the outline for that blog entry, that I can write on my memo pad that I carry around with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem intro with this statement at the end of Paragraph 1: <em>Let&rsquo;s explore a few strategies young writers can put to use right away.</em></li>
<li>Research Review: <em>Why Teaching Writing is Important</em></li>
<li>List of Strategies or solutions to the problem:
**   Strategy #1: Prepare Teachers To Write with research citation
**   Strategy #2: Teach Sentence Structures with research citation
**   Strategy #3: Write About Academic Content with research citation
**   More Strategies: A collection of strategies that I recommend</li>
<li>Wrap It Up</li>
</ul>
<p>While writing my problem intro, I came up with the title of the piece. Now, if I want to get controversial, or &ldquo;provocative,&rdquo; I can take an opposing view on ChatGPT or Artificial Intelligences (AI). </p>
<h2 id="writing-formula">Writing Formula</h2>
<p>It may surprise no one that I follow a formula when writing a blog. Sure, there are a variety of formulas for blog writing. My favorite is one I learned awhile back, <strong><a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com/2011/01/writing-ed-tech-list-article.html">the List Article.</a></strong> These days, I write that type of blog entry ALL the time. But it&rsquo;s not the only formula I follow.</p>
<p>Here are a few formulas, and I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert in any of them&hellip;no one is beating down my door with a book deal. I suspect it may be my own laziness. But this is a lot of fun, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>;-)</p>
<h2 id="formula-1-the-list">Formula #1: The List</h2>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhL4Jl1MVoy0dxxePrtyEG4mg-KkxkCWdwZw358HfISO8j4_2A4LtuuFbZvoFhcriyjhgsQ35ihwucdNDaejfggurj0tOCiFmrdj8DGipG9IzqTyXzHl8WXUt0ss1BjD3S-Cn6NFDLv1oLvUcPoRTqH3E8QLkHMMAfgvzcFRDFlgfSv1y10ifNTGvo5"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhL4Jl1MVoy0dxxePrtyEG4mg-KkxkCWdwZw358HfISO8j4_2A4LtuuFbZvoFhcriyjhgsQ35ihwucdNDaejfggurj0tOCiFmrdj8DGipG9IzqTyXzHl8WXUt0ss1BjD3S-Cn6NFDLv1oLvUcPoRTqH3E8QLkHMMAfgvzcFRDFlgfSv1y10ifNTGvo5" alt=""></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Start out with an engaging question, quote, or scenario.</li>
<li>Develop a list of follow-up questions (e.g. frequently asked questions are a good source of these kinds of questions) off the main topic. For maximum effect, you will want to develop an engaging quote, or scenario for each question before offering a short, pithy solution.</li>
<li>Conclude with a short summary or end with the final question that references how you started the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do a search on Google for &ldquo;TCEA Responds,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find a ton of examples. If I wrote it, that&rsquo;s the formula. Here&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://blog.tcea.org/personalized-learning-2/">another example</a></strong>, not necessarily my best, but close enough. This second example falls into the list of &ldquo;Five Steps&rdquo; or &ldquo;Five Ways&rdquo; or &ldquo;Three Tools&rdquo; or something along those lines. This is the easiest approach. You can use anything to kick off the article. </p>
<p>This was the easiest entry point for me, and is what helped me best understand how to write something for publication. Here&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com/2014/02/transformative-leadership-bridges.html">one of my favorite formula examples</a></strong>

<h2 id="formula-2-inverted-pyramid">Formula #2: Inverted Pyramid</h2>
<p>Ever since I read, Bruce Grundy&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/So-You-Want-Journalist-Unplugged/dp/1107692822">So You Want To Be a Journalist</a></strong>,&rdquo; I have wanted to write more inverted pyramid pieces. Reading my notes, it goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the news, what has happened, the most significant thing up front</li>
<li>The least of those, the least important shows up last.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick attempt at inverted pyramid&hellip;lots of fun opportunities to write stuff like this example. I wrote it for fun to celebrate that Google finally has an onboard, built-in screen casting alternative to third party apps like Screencastify (a great tool), or any of the zillion other similar tools.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-attempt-at-an-inverted-pyramid">My First Attempt at an Inverted Pyramid</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Chromebook users won&rsquo;t have to pay an annual subscription for a third-party app. Licenses for educators and students can cost thousands of dollars in fees. The Screencast app eliminates those costs. Built into the Chrome OS, the app integrates into the Chromebook like the Chrome browser or Docs.</p>
<p>Google expert Eric Curts <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/u/0/blog/post/edit/5377911962415510068/2794567188647138527#">says this new tool</a> makes recording a simple matter. It offers users an onboard tool they can use that&rsquo;s more powerful than what was available before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an easy way for teachers to create instructional videos, and for students to make recordings to demonstrate their understanding,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/u/0/blog/post/edit/5377911962415510068/2794567188647138527#">Free Tech For Teachers</a> author, Richard Byrne, said that you can need to update your Chromebook to the latest version of the Chrome OS.</p>
<p>This will make it easier for you to record a screencast on your Chromebook without using any extensions or 3rd party tools.</p>
<p>Your Chromebook will need to run Chrome OS M103 at minimum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gee, I hope I don&rsquo;t get into trouble with Eric and Richard for quoting/paraphrasing them. Well, that was fun. I can definitely see trying to write that as a blog entry for quick dissemination of information.</p>

<p>For fun, I revised <strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/men-diagnosed-advanced-prostate-cancer-psa-testing-drops-rcna65277">this news story</a></strong> and got this&hellip;it&rsquo;s a rewrite and borrows heavily from the original.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have advanced prostate cancer, you are less likely to respond well to treatment. The data comes from an American Cancer Society study published in early 2023. 
The second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. males, it rose 3% every year from 2014 to 2019. Researchers explain why in  <strong>CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians</strong>. The uptick in cancer deaths is due to increased diagnoses of advanced disease.  
Advanced prostate cancer is &ldquo;extremely difficult to treat,&rdquo; says the study&rsquo;s lead author, Rebecca Siegel. She is senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society. She goes on to say, &ldquo;There is no durable cure for those with metastatic disease.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t resist. Or another way to point it out</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Better get your prostate checked every year after 40,&rdquo; my dad would say. We had just walked out of the doctor&rsquo;s office. I was seventeen, and had the funny walk every man gets when he&rsquo;s had a doctor&rsquo;s finger, wrapped in a rubber glove and jellied, checking his prostate. I vowed to never get my prostate checked again. Fast forward a lifetime, and I remember crying into a towel on the couch. My Dad dropped by to let me know the news.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;d been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Allow me to share a few tips you need to keep in mind if you are a man. 
Before I share those tips for surviving prostate cancer, let me share some new information that came out in early 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-skinny-on-advanced-prostate">The Skinny on Advanced Prostate</h3>
<p>You may know why prostate cancer is so hard to treat if not caught early. One minute, your <strong><a href="https://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/psa-test-for-prostate-cancer/">PSAs</a></strong> are fine. The next, they warrant a visit to the Doc. The doctor calls you in, and gives you the bad news. There&rsquo;s something wrong. Worse, there&rsquo;s no cure for advanced prostate cancer that has metastasized, which spreads to multiple sites, all of them hard to reach. From 2014 to 2019, the CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians reported that it became the leading cause of cancer death in males in the United States. That&rsquo;s a three percent increase for a disease that has, as Rebecca Siegel puts it, &ldquo;no durable cure.&rdquo; 
How do you avoid getting prostate cancer, or catching it early? You drop your pants and let the proctologist have his way with you. Getting old sucks, doesn&rsquo;t it?
Let&rsquo;s explore five ways to keep yourself alive and kicking. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adopt a Mediterranean Diet.</strong> Avoid trans fats and saturated fats. Go for healthy fats from nuts, seeds, and fish.</li>
<li><strong>Drink green tea and eat soy.</strong> These can reduce your risk for prostate cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Eat more vegetables and fruit</strong>. Broccoli, cauliflower both contain sulforaphane, which may protect against cancer. They may make you gassy, but lower your risk. Cooked or processed tomatoes also slow the growth of prostate cancer cells.</li>
<li><strong>Skip the charred meat</strong>. Avoid that charred steak, whether fried or grilled. Charring meat produces a chemical that may increase your risk of cancer (<strong><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-prevention">source</a></strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Stay healthy</strong>. Get regular exercise, don&rsquo;t smoke or drink alcohol, and take Vitamin D. Oh, and have lots of sex.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note to Reader</strong>: There&rsquo;s more ways to get it done, and I&rsquo;d probably write a bit more about each, but this is a quick <strong><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-prevention">summary of info from Hopkins Medicine</a>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="a-final-smoke">A Final Smoke</h3>
<p>My Dad always wished for a final smoke before he died of lung cancer many years later. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, my Dad didn&rsquo;t die of prostate cancer, but cancer got him all the same. Darn those stogies. So, in addition to the five ways to stay alive, try to work some diet, exercise, and fun into your time on earth. Who knows, your prostate may let you live a long life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that fun? Here are a few more tips I decided to throw in for fun.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-tips">Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<p>Some miscellaneous tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://cogdogblog.com/2006/10/linktribution/">Practice Linktribution</a></strong>, as Alan Levine says it. Be generous in your links to others. In a blog entry, link to lots of other people. Swipe a sentence from their blog entry, put quotes around it, link to it, then head off in a different direction than it suggests. Or argue with it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to pick fights with other bloggers' ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run other&rsquo;s ideas through your mill</strong>, and see what happens. If poop comes out, share that. Maybe you don&rsquo;t know what the heck you&rsquo;re talking about. Say so. It&rsquo;s a blog, not an academic journal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep it short</strong>. Maybe, limit yourself between 500-1000 words. Write a lot of short pieces that are centered around the same theme or topic. Then put them together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use subheadings.</strong> I use subheadings for emails, and they can break up long paragraphs. That&rsquo;s why list articles are so easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Try bulleted lists</strong>&hellip;they are easy to process.</p>

<p>Entertain yourself with your blogging piece. I had a laugh writing this! Juxtapose ideas or formulas to get creative. Take something serious and mix into a comedy, or vice versa. </p>
<h2 id="a-fun-exercise">A Fun Exercise</h2>
<p>What might be fun is to go back to my original writing strategies blog entry that I&rsquo;m writing. Then, re-write it using the different formulas. Well, I did that with the prostate thing, throwing in an inverted pyramid and a listicle. I also threw in a funny cat pic. Why not do all three when playing with a blog entry&rsquo;s content?</p>

			 <p>As much as I loved my graduate level professors, I have found their approach to teaching reading&hellip;problematic. I remember beginning my year teaching third grade bilingual, working with children who needed to learn to read in English. At the time, as I was prepping my classroom in the portable building, one of the paraeducators was shocked at my actions. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to teach phonics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember chuckling, and saying, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the way it&rsquo;s done anymore.&rdquo; But, now, I know better. Fortunately, all but one of my students knew how to read. My Writing/Reading Workshop approach worked and they learned to read and write in spite of my ignorance.</p>
<h2 id="phonics-works">Phonics Works</h2>
<p>Now, I know that I should have learned how to teach phonics. This was driven home when I read Nate Joseph&rsquo;s piece, <strong><em><a href="https://www.teachingbyscience.com/a-meta-analysis-of-language-programs?utm_source=pocket_mylist">A Meta-Analysis and Literature Review of Language Programs</a>.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="mynotes">MyNotes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Despite the fact that this meta-analysis was conducted 20 years after the National Reading Panel meta-analysis, with studies included up to 2022, I found the identical mean effect size for phonics, of .45. I also conducted a secondary meta-analysis of 13 phonics meta-analyses conducted over the last 25 years, which found a mean effect size of phonics, of .43.</li>
<li>Phonics interventions showed efficacious results, both for early primary instruction, and for older students with reading deficits. This suggests that students should receive phonics instruction during their foundational education years and that if they miss this instruction that they benefit from getting it later on.</li>
<li>Phonics heavy programs outperformed Balanced Literacy programs across all grades, and sample types. Indeed phonics programs showed roughly double the impact for grades 1-2, at risk learners, and class based instruction. This research does not show support for the use of Balanced Literacy programs, over phonics focused programs, in any context.</li>
<li>The data showed higher outcomes for shorter phonics studies, and for longer balanced literacy studies.</li>
<li>one logical explanation might be that phonics programs might work more efficiently. As teaching students to memorize large amounts of words takes more instruction, it makes sense that Balanced Literacy programs might take longer to show a positive effect for students, as it is an in-efficient method for instruction. Whereas, some students might learn how to decode from phonics quite quickly and the phonics programs might show diminishing returns over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nate writes a bit more, but these are the parts that jumped out at me as most profound. And, that I had to spend some time worrying at, a dog with a bone.</p>

			 <p>Given the <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/05/writing-outside-a.html">resource I shared about writing outside earlier</a></strong>, I wondered if students might find writing outside more meaningful. Also, given how easy AI makes it to generate text, I can see how this Jacobson quote below might resonate strongly with educators and others who think, &ldquo;Ya, para que?&rdquo; which is the equivalent of &ldquo;Why bother now?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now that students no longer find it meaningful to write, how do we build the skills that writing used to train? Structured critical thinking, argumentation, logic, and - yes - even knowledge stored in human brains still seem like fundamentals for the 21st century.&rdquo;
-Jon Ask Jacobson</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="defining-terms">Defining Terms</h2>
<p>What does Jon mean when he uses these terms below?</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured Critical Thinking</li>
<li>Argumentation</li>
<li>Logic</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question that vexes me, probably because no matter how much I learn about critical thinking processes, acronyms, and steps, doing critical thinking is difficult. It&rsquo;s not natural. It&rsquo;s not easy. Writing, which allows me to think through a question, gets me closer to acting like a critical thinker. If you take writing away, I&rsquo;m left trying to imagine blocks of thought floating in the air, a visualization that fails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not until I put ideas down on paper or a screen that I start to be able to move them around, put them in a different sequence.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-structured-critical-thinking">Understanding Structured Critical Thinking</h1>
<h2 id="chatgpt-plus-interpretation">ChatGPT Plus' Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one take on &ldquo;structured critical thinking&rdquo; via ChatGPT Plus:</p>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Definition:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Structured critical thinking is a process that helps us make decisions and solve problems by carefully examining information, questioning assumptions, and evaluating evidence. It involves a series of steps that guide us in analyzing information objectively and making reasoned judgments. This process can be particularly helpful for young learners as it encourages curiosity, enhances problem-solving skills, and promotes a deeper understanding of various topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="three-step-process">Three Step Process</h3>
<p>Below is a three-step process tailored for young minds. This process is designed to be easy to remember and apply in various scenarios, from classroom projects to everyday decisions.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Step</strong></th>
<th><strong>What to Do</strong></th>
<th><strong>Key Questions to Ask</strong></th>
<th><strong>Example</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. <strong>Observe and Question</strong></td>
<td>Start by observing the situation or information presented to you. Ask questions about what you see, hear, or read.</td>
<td>What do I notice? What do I wonder?</td>
<td>You&rsquo;re learning about the importance of bees in ecosystems. You notice that bees pollinate plants and wonder why bees are essential for plant pollination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. <strong>Gather and Evaluate</strong></td>
<td>Collect information from reliable sources to answer your questions. Evaluate the credibility of your sources and the evidence they provide.</td>
<td>Where is the information from? Is it trustworthy? How does this evidence support or contradict what I know?</td>
<td>You gather information from science textbooks, educational websites, and a documentary about bees. You evaluate the reliability of these sources and how they explain the role of bees in pollination and ecosystem health.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. <strong>Reflect and Decide</strong></td>
<td>Reflect on the information you&rsquo;ve gathered and use it to form your own reasoned conclusions. Consider how this new understanding might influence your thoughts or actions.</td>
<td>What have I learned? How does this change what I thought before? What will I do with this information?</td>
<td>You conclude that bees are crucial for pollinating many plants, including those that produce fruits and vegetables we eat. This changes your view on the importance of protecting bee habitats, and you decide to start a small garden to help local bee populations.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="chatgpts-conclusion">ChatGPT&rsquo;s Conclusion</h3>
<p>This structured critical thinking process encourages young learners to be curious and analytical, developing skills that will benefit them throughout their education and beyond. By observing and questioning, gathering and evaluating, and finally reflecting and deciding, students learn to approach problems systematically and make informed decisions.</p>
<h2 id="my-takeaways">My Takeaways</h2>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m not sure my takeaways are all that valuable. I like the process identified above. It&rsquo;s certainly a lot more straightforward than others I&rsquo;ve encountered. Like FLOATER, CRITIC, and other critical thinking processes, it appears you are always checking the quality of the information and where it came from. You start out observing and asking questions about what you&rsquo;re seeing. Then, you make a decision.</p>
<p>In the example shown above, there&rsquo;s a big jump from step 2 to 3 in the example. I wonder what specific strategies might be offered for each step.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpts-concrete-actions-for-each-step">ChatGPT&rsquo;s Concrete Actions for Each Step</h2>
<h3 id="1-observe-and-question">1. Observe and Question</h3>

			 <p>My favorite approach to writing? It&rsquo;s pretty easy to follow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I walked into the bookstore&ndash;which was attached to the conference building I was presenting&ndash;in Dallas, I had no idea what book I&rsquo;d find that would have a lasting influence on my writing.</p>
<p>The 1990&rsquo;s book, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Digest-Handbook-Magazine-Writing/dp/0898794080">The Handbook of Magazine Article Writing</a></strong> (get a copy), contained useful advice for a novice. The article below is my version of the piece that had such a profound influence on my writing for publication&hellip;over 100 in print, what a surprise.</p>
<p>The two top question writers hear often include, “Where do you get your ideas for articles?” and “How do you have time to write?” I get my inspiration from questions people ask, or that I ask myself. </p>
<h2 id="find-a-question-to-answer-or-a-problem-to-solve">Find A Question To Answer, or A Problem to Solve</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The list article is designed to solve problems, present information, and help the reader,&rdquo; says Charles Main, the writer who introduced me to the list article. I read his version of the instructions in the 1990s version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Digest-Handbook-Magazine-Writing/dp/0898794080">The Handbook of Magazine Article Writing</a>. With the list article framework in mind, I can write about anything.</p>
<p>For example, at a recent gathering of technology directors, someone walked up to me and asked, “How did you take notes and format them so quickly on the web?” These simple questions are the foundations of new articles that allow me list the qualities of a wiki like Google Sites, Microsoft OneNote, or Google Docs.</p>
<p>This makes it perfect for education technologists to use to share their stories of success. I hope you’ll follow the suggestions in this article and submit your own to some publication.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-the-list-article">HOW-TO WRITE THE LIST ARTICLE</h2>
<p>The list article is my favorite article write because it is so simple. Here are the steps I follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start</strong> out with an engaging question, quote, or scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Develop</strong> a list of follow-up questions (e.g. frequently asked questions are a good source of these kinds of questions) off the main topic. For maximum effect, you will want to develop an engaging quote, or scenario for each question before offering a short, pithy solution.</li>
<li><strong>Conclude</strong> with a short summary or end with the final question that references how you started the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see that list article formula in action. Note how I start with item #1 above down below.</p>
<h2 id="1-engaging-questionquotescenario">1) ENGAGING QUESTION/QUOTE/SCENARIO</h2>
<p>Here are a few examples of engaging questions, quotes, scenarios I’ve used in the past for my education technology articles, including some from the <strong>Download a la Mode</strong> series featured in TechEdge, a series of articles that answers the essential question for educators—what free stuff is available and out there?</p>
<ul>
<li>“Your support in Technology,” shared the Human Resources Associate Superintendent in an email, “is the reason that we are able to realize these initiatives. Thanks so much for your help.” Of course, she was referring to the Clerical Assessment Battery (CAB), a screening program for new job applicants to the District. It’s implementation would save the Human Resources Department time in assessing clerical job applicants. Read the rest online at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4cymy8">http://tinyurl.com/4cymy8</a></li>
<li>As a chief technology officer or director of technology, probably one of the toughest challenges you face isn’t keeping up with the technology, but rather understanding how to leverage it for your organization. While in the past, we were limited by the occasions that served as “learning experiences,” in the 21st century, learning isn’t restricted to a special event bound by time and place. We don’t learn just when sitting in a meeting, or at a conference or from 8:00 to 3:30 PM when school is in session. Today, we have the potential to tap into a flow of conversation, a web-based learning ecology, that we can learn from 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Read the rest online at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ywfzy2">http://tinyurl.com/ywfzy2</a></li>
<li>“I can’t wait for my mobile phone to ring. And, if they don’t call me,” shares one beleaguered principal trapped in a principals’ meeting, “I call them as I walk out pretending that I’ve received an all-important ‘Please deliver us!’ call from my campus.” Like a child playing an online action game at CartoonNetwork.com, principals roll from problem to problem, guns blazing, from meeting to problem to meeting.</li>
<li>“So, what new software,” I ask myself some late evenings, “is available out there for free?” Over the last few months of research, over 51 software programs have jumped out at me, 92% are free (or, if you prefer, 95% of Windows programs mentioned here are free, as opposed to 75% free Mac programs). On the Windows side, you could get by with free tools and not purchase a single program. On the Mac, purchase depends on what your needs are, and, Macs come with many free software tools already (e.g. iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie). Also, you won’t need all 51 or more software programs depending on your platform, needs, or choices. You have a few choices to pick from!</li>
<li>“The thief broke in, stole my computer, my USB external drive,” the potential identity theft victim began, “and now I’m worried that my unencrypted bank account files, my social security number and health information…my whole life is out there on the Internet being shared among thieves.” If you have not considered this scenario, then you need to. How do we protect computer data against unauthorized use?</li>
<li>“What do you mean I can’t install software on my desktop computer when I want to?” asked Charlie. “You mean, I can’t just download software and install it? What if I need it with my students?” It’s not an uncommon question. More and more school districts are placing restrictions on the rights of teachers to select and install software they view as relevant to classroom needs and/or instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I start each of the articles with some question or quote. This is usually a real quote I’ve heard from someone. I get questions from email, social media like Facebook groups and Twitter. If I don&rsquo;t know the answers, I check to see what others are saying (and cite them). While learning from other&rsquo;s responses is fun, even more engaging is when I figure out my own response. What an easy way to research, don&rsquo;t you agree? </p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="did-you-know">Did You Know?** </h3>
<p>List articles are now popularly known as &ldquo;listicles.&rdquo; Although a bit disparaging, listicles get the job done because they are easy to conceive, research, write, and consume. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another neat approach is to incorporate into the response of each follow-up question a short scenario. Example follows below in the response to this next follow-up question.</p>
<p>Writing a list of follow-up questions—the list—is also pretty easy. In preparing for my <strong>Download a la Mode</strong> series, I often use my bookmarking tool to note great programs that are worth using and can solve specific problems for user questions that I read about or hear.</p>
<p>Often, the source for questions comes from casual conversations with people I connect with during the work week, as well as the hundreds of emails that drop into my inbox. I’ve been augmenting my access to questions by reading a variety of blogs that also share solutions without problems. From that point, it’s easy to make my own connections and I usually write about them in my <strong><a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com">Around the Corner</a></strong> blog, which is an education-centric blog.</p>
<p>Here are a few follow questions on the subject of <strong>Download a la Mode</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I uninstall a program on my Macbook so that ALL the preferences and settings are gone?</li>
<li>How can I easily combine PDF files without Adobe Acrobat Professional?</li>
<li>How can I turn turn a USB Flash drive into a Mac OS X diagnostic, repair, and maintenance tool?</li>
<li>How do I run a Windows programs on an Intel Macbook?</li>
</ul>
<p>As I shared in the previous section, a winning technique is to include a mini-scenario for each follow-up question. So, in response to the question, Where can I find an easy to use staff appraisal tool for my handheld computer?, I wrote the following mini-scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I do a staff appraisal,” shares Suzanne, a district level appraiser for a large Texas school district, “I walk into the classroom, pick out a spot, take my legal notepad, draw a line down the middle, and start writing. It’s not until I get back to the office that I start pulling the notes together, doing the reflection needed, to do my appraisal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“When I open something to read, if it doesn’t have a lot of dialogue, I don’t bother reading it.” my Dad would say. By including these mini-scenarios to the top of my response for each individual follow-up question, the reader is more engaged because the problem is relevant and real. </p>
<h2 id="3-summary-conclusion-or-concluding-question">3-SUMMARY CONCLUSION OR CONCLUDING QUESTION</h2>
<p>As much fun as a list article is to write it’s also fun to bring it to a close. Here are some of the ways I’ve ended other list articles; note that each bullet represents a conclusion to a list article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wishing can be a dangerous experience for handheld computer implementation in your district. As administrators, we seldom have the time to seek out what we need. If the Palm Handheld Computer will not work for us the way we need it to, we may choose to go back to the old way of doing things. Yet, the power of “I wish” can also transform how we do our work, if only we can realize the benefits we wish for.</li>
<li>Next time you find yourself sitting in a meeting, and someone says, “Hey, when you get back to the office, find out what’s been done about this,” you won’t be limited to a simple affirmative. Instead, email your secretary and find out what IS happening and report back to the group. Or, keep your inbox clear as you multi-task your way through a meeting. Even more so, you can share data with students and teachers. All the data is in the Palm of your hand, and data-driven administration is what it’s all about these days.</li>
<li>While some see the use of encryption tools like those discussed in this article as the recourse of the paranoid, remember that identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States. If you are a victim of identity theft, you may spend an average of 607 hours and at least, a $1000, in clearing your name. Make sure that your computer is not one of the sources of confidential information. Protecting yourself online is as much a digital literacy as being information literate. Pass it on!</li>
<li>One of my favorite quotes — which came to me via Mark Wagner — is, “He who learns from one who is learning, drinks from a flowing river.” I hope you’ll continue to learn every moment and share that learning via the list article with others. The rewards are infinite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Remember that the list article format can be used for almost anything—article to be published, email, summary meeting notes—and is adaptable to ANY subject you might want to share about. What is even more thrilling about the list article is that you can write anything and use writing you have published elsewhere as examples, exactly like I’ve done here.</p>
<p>Give it a try, won’t you?</p>

			 <p>Wanting to explore ChatGPT Plus and have even more fun with AI? Wait, before you say, &ldquo;No, AI is destroying everything!&rdquo; take a moment to learn how to use it in ways that can be useful to your workflow. Sure, it&rsquo;s a quick how-to article that could assist you in boosting your productivity and put those long prompts you&rsquo;ve been writing to use.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In <strong><a href="https://blog.tcea.org/custom-gpt/">this blog entry at the TCEA.org blog, TechNotes, I share some of my uses of ChatGPT Plus to create a custom GPT</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from my blog entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with ChatGPT and other AI tools can often feel like you’re a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. But there is another trick you may want to practice and learn: how to create your own custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) using ChatGPT Plus, the paid version of ChatGPT. A custom GPT is a tailored version of the original ChatGPT model that has been modified to serve specific purposes. Let’s take a look at the process for making a custom GPT.
Why make your own GPT?
One of the reasons you might want to make a custom GPT is that it can be helpful to have an assistant. For example, I would love to have an assistant to help me with applying critical thinking processes to claims of pseudoscience. Here are a few other possible reasons why K-16 educators might consider making a custom GPT&hellip;.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Should your PreK-5 student be using that technology?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a question that pops up in my head every time I&rsquo;m out eating and see a device babysitting a child. Since I had a different point of view many years ago, it&rsquo;s clear I had another think coming.</p>
<h2 id="arguing-with-your-boss-to-be">Arguing with Your Boss To Be</h2>
<p>I had a longstanding argument with a colleague in a large urban school district. We had started out as directors together (she later became my boss). We were both raising young children. Since my kids were a bit older, I felt quite wise as a father to impart advice (sigh).</p>
<p>Her young son loved to play video games, use technology, but she tightly controlled his time spent on this endeavor. At the time, I argued that learning to use technology was quite important, as important as other activities he might engage in as a young person. I found myself wondering, &ldquo;What IS the evidence on this topic?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="note-about-ai-usage-in-this-blog">Note: About AI Usage in this Blog</h2>
<p>Hey, can we agree that unless I say otherwise, my summaries are coming from Perplexity.ai Pro? If it&rsquo;s ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever, I&rsquo;ll say so. Also, citations appear at the end of a blog entry. AI results will be marked off in their section unless included as a blockquote.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-evidence-is-in">The Evidence is In</h2>
<p>A brief AI-powered summary via Perplexity.AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scientific consensus on students in PreK-5 using technology emphasizes the importance of mindful and appropriate use of technology<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to support learning and development. Research highlights the need for adults to actively curate children&rsquo;s screen activities by prioritizing educational content, avoiding commercial programs, and combining touch screen use with creative or active play[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the Department of Education emphasizes that technology, when used appropriately, can be a tool for learning, helping young children explore new worlds, engage in fun activities, and learn problem-solving skills[4]. The guidance stresses that technology should be used to enhance learning opportunities for all children, strengthen relationships among parents, families, educators, and children, and is most effective when adults and peers interact or co-view with young children[4].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This consensus underscores the significance of integrating technology thoughtfully to support early childhood development and learning experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the risks (per AI) include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The potential risks of using technology in PreK-5 education encompass various aspects that educators and parents should be mindful of.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Exposure to Inappropriate Content</strong>: Technology can provide access to unsuitable content, potentially distracting students and exposing them to harmful information. Implementing security measures like website blockers, internet filters, and close supervision can mitigate this risk[1].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Socialization Challenges</strong>: Excessive use of technology may lead to reduced social interactions among children, impacting their social development. Balancing technology time with opportunities for face-to-face interactions is crucial to ensure healthy social growth[2].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health and Accessibility Concerns</strong>: Prolonged screen time can contribute to vision issues in developing eyes. Teachers and parents should monitor signs of eye strain and limit screen time or use blue light filters to protect children&rsquo;s eyesight. Additionally, ensuring that technology tools are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, is essential[3].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and Cybersecurity Issues</strong>: Technology integration raises concerns about privacy and cybersecurity risks for students. It is important for educators and parents to be vigilant about protecting students' privacy online and educating them about safe internet practices[4].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on Mental Health</strong>: Excessive technology use has been linked to mental health issues such as depression, increased risk of cyberbullying, and reduced physical activity leading to obesity. Monitoring children&rsquo;s media consumption and promoting a healthy balance between technology use and other activities is crucial[4].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these risks, I suspect schools spend a lot of time focused on #s 3 and 4, leaving parents to focus on #1, #2, #5, and #6. We already know that time spent on technology IN school can affect academic performance. See below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Screen time hurts kids brains…the impact of screen time was negative, significant, and came with specific consequences, including deficits in attention, impulse control, executive functioning, and overall cognitive functioning.
Some studies included in the meta-analysis indicated that screen time can lead to lower levels of brain connectivity and even hinder brain growth.

<p>With that research in mind, I thought I&rsquo;d mention I&rsquo;m presenting this summer at the TCEA Elementary Technology Conference (ETC).</p>
<h2 id="last-day-to-submit-presentations-is-march-4-2024-today">Last Day to Submit Presentations is March 4, 2024 (today)</h2>
<p>Time is short to submit your presentation for the Elementary Technology Conference in Galveston, Tx June 9-11, 2024. Don&rsquo;t miss this awesome opportunity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering if I&rsquo;ll be there, well, yes, they are letting me present a few sessions. Here&rsquo;s a short list of the working titles and descriptions, all subject to change:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Vocabulary Skills with Videos</strong>. Do your students struggle learning new vocabulary words? If so, come learn how to make those words come alive through video. You bring a device with a camera and I will bring the paper. You will be working in groups to create awesome content, whether it&rsquo;s a vocabulary video or animated GIF.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Activities and Tools</strong>. Want to create exciting learning activity templates for use in other programs like Seesaw or Kami? Need to craft a memo or newsletter for staff or parents? Explore how Canva&rsquo;s Magic Studio (including AI apps), their extensive template library, can make your creative process easier.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Classroom eBooks</strong>. Get your students more engaged with your content by having them become authors. Learn how to use tools like Book Creator, Canva, and Google Workspace to create digital ebooks.

<li><strong>Design Thinking in the Classroom</strong>. Learn the methodology that designers use as a creative way to develop solutions for specific problems.You’ll be amazed at how easy it is to use in your classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching with Claim Evidence and Reasoning (CER) and AI</strong>. Explore engaging activities and even learn how to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into your CER lessons. Get ready to ignite your students' love for science and witness their incredible creations through CER.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m also facilitating a three hour pre-conference session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enhancing Young Learners' Literacy and Learning: Digital and Evidence-Based Strategies for Accelerating Academic Growth.</strong> Dive into a comprehensive, three-hour workshop designed to empower K-12 teachers with advanced strategies for fostering literacy and accelerating academic growth among students. This engaging session combines the power of evidence-based literacy strategies, digital tools for outlining and summarizing, and the effective use of concept mapping to transform your teaching approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some specific areas of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover a wide array of proven techniques aimed at enhancing literacy across K-12 settings, focusing on the integration of specific tools that have shown significant positive impacts on student learning. We&rsquo;ll explore how the act of summarizing, not only as a digital skill but also as a self-regulation strategy, can have a dramatic effect on students' ability to control their own learning, mirroring the benefits of reciprocal teaching with an effect size of .74.</li>
<li>Moreover, learn how outlining and summarizing, alongside concept mapping, are not just critical skills but are also capable of accelerating academic growth by 1.5 years within a single school year. By adopting these strategies, teachers can facilitate a more engaging and effective learning environment, enabling students to identify main ideas, articulate them in their own words, and use digital tools to enhance their understanding and retention of material.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have a lot of work to do to put these sessions together, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to reflecting a lot of the research and evidence-based practices. In the meantime, I hope you&rsquo;ll consider submitting a presentation and drop by to say &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h2>
<p>My colleague in that large urban district was right, of course, to limit her child&rsquo;s access to technology. It&rsquo;s important for all of us working in schools to read up on the latest research. Like me, you may have another think coming about the best uses of technology in the classroom with young children. While tech can open doors, demolish classroom walls that impede collaboration at a distance, increase productivity, it can also pose serious risks. Risks that schools aren&rsquo;t as well-prepared to manage or handle.</p>

			 <p>While chatting with a colleague, they made the following observation about my work as a K-12 educator in educational technology. I found it a fascinating perspective and insight. So, I wrote it down, waited a few  years before sharing it online. ;-)
At the end, I share the results of The Orwell Test applied to the assertions. It offers an alternate way of gauging the accuracy, but as you&rsquo;ll see, it&rsquo;s a matter of opinion as these things often are without evidence.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>You were the token Latino in the 80s. They could hire you and not get backlash about not having Latinos/diversity. But you&rsquo;re good, you exceeded their expectations, and you have real individual power and ability. And it freaks out those above you in the power structure. Further, it&rsquo;s been forty years of hard work and you&rsquo;re not seeing the payout because your presence and the presence of other tokenized people like you didn&rsquo;t change the power structure, it just allowed them to say &ldquo;Diversity!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which was a purposeful way they set things up, because they had no intention of letting the power structure change. And you&rsquo;re feeling the effects even harder now because you&rsquo;re looking around and wondering why things haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because you have not been let into the group in charge, and they have actively excluded you and other ethnic and racial groups as groups. They also only mentor the same people who remind themselves of themselves, like white old men mentor young white men. So, no mentoring, no being let into the inner circle, even active dislike/refusal to promote.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Based on The Orwell Test, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this narrative would be considered highly suspect or potentially propagandistic due to failing all three criteria<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: it lacks verifiable facts supported by broader evidence, comes from a single source without corroboration, and does not employ a methodological approach that includes engagement with broader data or research. This assessment suggests a need for caution and further investigation into the claims made within the narrative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that while personal experiences and observations are crucial for understanding individual and collective challenges, evaluating systemic issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes diverse sources, verifiable data, and methodological analysis.</p>

			 <p>Blog rolls. They seem a thing of the past, an archaic habit consecrated by time long past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very old fashioned way of keeping track of, and linking your blog to other blogs of note. <strong><a href="https://troypatterson.me/2024/03/02/blog-rolls/">Troy Patterson</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://werd.io/2024/why-i-wont-have-a-blogroll">Ben Werd</a></strong> share their respective opinions about this old practice.</p>

<p>I do like blogrolls. They are an additional way to discover neat people and blogs. Most of my discovery right now is through Mastodon. With the movement back to self-hosted content, blogrolls could be valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although no one has asked, blog rolls are fun. In the old days, when blogs were still a conversation among far flung outposts of thought, they were like a length of telephone string, bridging the wide gap. They are an open invitation to bloggers on it that, &ldquo;Hey, anytime you come here, I have something to chat with you about. Write about something I&rsquo;m writing, and I&rsquo;ll return the favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in that spirit of string telephones (cup phones) and friendly chats on virtual front porches, I&rsquo;ll share <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/blogroll/">my burgeoning blog roll</a></strong>. Some things may be old, but some old things may yet serve.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/03/ten-sayings-epictetus.html">Ten Sayings: Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/03/ten-sayings-epictetus.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-03-03 06:00:00 -0500">Mar 3, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">

<p>Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius are two people I hadn&rsquo;t heard much about except the occasional mention of Emperor Aurelius. But <strong><a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html">Epictetus' Enchiridion</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html">Aurelius' Meditations</a></strong>? Not so much.</p>
<p>That I was ignorant was probably as much my fault as that of anyone, but I&rsquo;m grateful that I stumbled upon them. I forget the exact moment I started reading Epictetus' work&hellip;last year, perhaps. I&rsquo;d become a bit disillusioned as a result of the crazy stuff going on with Christian Nationalism, as well as a reading of &ldquo;actual&rdquo; histories. Pretty sobering stuff. The more I&rsquo;ve read, the more I realize how pervasive these types of sayings and bits of wisdom are.</p>
<h2 id="bits-of-wisdom">Bits of Wisdom</h2>
<p>So I thought, wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to get an AI model to summarize some of the best sayings of Epictetus and Aurelius? Save me the time of pulling those up. I don&rsquo;t know if you do it, but I keep a few quotes written down in a notebook, if not an online space. Here is one of my favorite compilations, which I actually have engraved in one of my fancier notebooks. It&rsquo;s not a bad reminder to keep in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice in what you have, cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of your will, make the best of what is in your power and take the rest as it comes. Latin: non fui, fui, non-sum, non-curo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, consider this one from Plato:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who are able to see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood, let alone believed, by the masses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyways, I thought it might be fun to see what Epictetus or Aurelius had to say about a cherished value. I had the idea as I was looking at one of those little Gideon New Testaments with a word followed by a scripture quote. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to have something similar with Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius?</p>
<h3 id="top-10-sayings-of-epictetus">Top 10 Sayings of Epictetus</h3>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve read <em>Enchiridion</em> (it&rsquo;s pretty short) several times, I haven&rsquo;t made my way entirely through <em>Meditations</em>. I hope I&rsquo;ll get to rectify that going forward. In the meantime, here&rsquo;s what Perplexity.ai Pro thought were the top 10 sayings for Epictetus and Aurelius&hellip;this time.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are 10 top sayings of Epictetus from simplest to implement to the most difficult? Place a one word descriptor in front of each saying or lesson. Word the saying in modern language to make it easier to understand and write them at a fifth grade reading level.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="epictetus-sayings-in-modern-language">Epictetus' Sayings in Modern Language</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acceptance</strong>: “Do your best with what you can control and accept everything else as it happens.”</li>
<li><strong>Freedom</strong>: “You’re only truly free when you can control yourself.”</li>
<li><strong>Friendship</strong>: “Finding a true friend when things are bad is very hard.”</li>
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: “You are not just your looks or your stuff, but what you choose to do.”</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: “You can’t learn new things if you think you know everything.”</li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>: “We don’t know why people do what they do, so don’t be quick to judge them.”</li>
<li><strong>Perception</strong>: “It’s not what happens to you, but how you think about it that matters.”</li>
<li><strong>Self-Discovery</strong>: “Tough times show you who you really are.”</li>
<li><strong>Self-Mastery</strong>: “Being in charge of your own thoughts and feelings is the best kind of freedom.”</li>
<li><strong>Thoughtfulness</strong>: “Think carefully before you speak or act.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The AI was kind enough to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These sayings, simplified for easier understanding, encapsulate key principles of Stoicism as taught by Epictetus, emphasizing self-control, the importance of inner freedom, and the value of understanding our own perceptions and reactions to the world around us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting a new blog, goofing up the domain name for an established blog (<a href="https://www.mguhlin.org">www.mguhlin.org</a> isn&rsquo;t working anymore, but you can find Around the Corner at <a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com">mguhlin.blogspot.com</a>) hasn&rsquo;t been fun. What has been fun is</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing in Markdown. It slows me down a little, making me think a bit about what I&rsquo;m saying. It&rsquo;s like getting a new pen and pad of paper that you want to write on. Do you put the ** to bold something before or after the link in parenthesis? (after, BTW)</li>
<li>Asking myself, &ldquo;What do I want to focus on in this iteration of my blog?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>One question that hasn&rsquo;t really arisen? Is blogging really dead? Well, I mean, I wrote about it in <strong><a href="https://mgblog.org/2024/03/02/is-the-blog.html">this entry</a></strong>, but obviously, the answer is, &ldquo;No&rdquo; as <strong><a href="https://zirk.us/@noplasticshower/112027922814559552">@noplasticshower responded via Mastodon</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="harold-jarches-take">Harold Jarche&rsquo;s Take</h2>
<p>Harold makes some great points in <strong><a href="https://jarche.com/2024/02/dead-blog-walking-at-20/">his 02-19-2024 blog entry</a></strong>. He even quotes that venerable favorite every blogger back in the day read, Rick Levine&rsquo;s  <em><strong><a href="https://www.cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a></strong></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year I said that I hoped that we see a return to more people blogging as they realize how much surveillance capitalism and the platform monopolists are robbing from citizens and civil society.
“A knowledge worker is someone whose job is having really interesting conversations at work.” —Rick Levine (1999) The Cluetrain Manifesto — and that’s what blogging is all about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can get behind the idea that &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a></strong>&rdquo; is bad (capital &ldquo;B&rdquo; bad?) and that platform monopolists are stealing from us all. It often feels quite difficult to imagine&hellip;we&rsquo;re drowning in all the PR and services shoved down our throats.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways-from-the-cluetrain-manifesto">Takeaways from The Cluetrain Manifesto</h2>
<p><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em> is full of great ideas whose time has come and then been ignored to some degree. That said, here are a few ideas that continue to ring true for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers, we are human beings. And our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->People in networked markets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have figured out that they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get far better information and support from one another<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than from vendors. So much for corporate rhetoric about adding value to commoditized products.</li>
<li>Respect for hands-on knowledge wins over respect for abstract authority.</li>
<li>Command-and-control management styles both derive from and reinforce bureaucracy, power tripping and an overall culture of paranoia.</li>
<li>When we have questions we turn to each other for answers. If you didn&rsquo;t have such a tight rein on &ldquo;your people&rdquo; maybe they&rsquo;d be among the people we&rsquo;d turn to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Harold shares that he uses his blog as a way to connect with other professionals. That&rsquo;s less true for me these days. What I use it for now is getting my &ldquo;half-baked ideas&rdquo; out there, not only for future use but to exorcise them from my thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to fall for stupid stuff, to think and believe stupid stuff. Pretty soon, it starts clogging your brain paths. By writing it down, you&rsquo;re getting it out of your head. At least, that&rsquo;s what I see happening.</p>
<h2 id="doug-johnson-responds">Doug Johnson Responds</h2>
<p>Doug from The Blue Skunk Blog dropped a comment via email to me, which I&rsquo;ll share here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I continue to struggle with the need/reason/content for my blog, especially now that I have stepped back from education and technology and school libraries. (Retired now for nearly 5 years!) As always, I continue to blog for my own amusement and if others get some joy from reading my posts, all the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding purpose to write reminds me that we&rsquo;re not our jobs. <em>Around the Corner</em> was a blog I started to process and explore new technologies in a leadership role. But these days, while I might still be in a leadership role, I lack the same enthusiasm to write about the latest gadget.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen edtech come and go, and it&rsquo;s mostly a flash in the pan. Every year, you get some new tech and then people chase after it, trying to be the ONE who shares or makes something everyone will want to click on and read. In a few months, it&rsquo;s over and onto the next big thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASIDE:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Right now, that big thing is AI. AI is everywhere, you can&rsquo;t swing a mouse from the tail without hitting somebody or something discussing AI. But in the final analysis, will AI as it is now and how it might be next month going to fundamentally change how the human brain works? Probably not. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t useful, that we all don&rsquo;t need to learn more about it, but&hellip;calm down folks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, I find myself, in this blog (<em>Another Think Coming</em>) trying to find my voice again, that sense of authenticity. Whether people read it or not, eh, who cares? That was never my reason for blogging. But if I can make it a little more fun, why not?</p>
<p>Doug goes on to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed your recent posts. One of them made me think of a book I recently read titled <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556">The Scout Mindset</a></strong> by Julia Galef. I was sufficiently impressed with it to buy copies for my grandson. Clarity of thinking seems more important than ever in this crazy world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, I have also picked up a copy of Galef&rsquo;s book. It&rsquo;s sitting in my pile of unread books I need to get to. That will be another blog post, I&rsquo;m sure. Soon.</p>
<h2 id="a-cemetery-of-ideas">A Cemetery of Ideas</h2>
<p>As I go back over old blog entries, I realize how many other blogs have simply faded away. But there are also old web pages, blog entries that have vibrant stories to tell&hellip;if only someone would read them. They are a cemetery of ideas, waiting for a zombie virus to reanimate their corpses, to see what, if anything, they can spread their ideas to.</p>
<p>The concept of an idea virus isn&rsquo;t new. I became aware of it when Seth Godin shared it in 2000 with his book, which you can still download online for free, here: <strong><a href="https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/2000Ideavirus.pdf">Unleashing the Idea Virus</a></strong>.</p>
<p>A short summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marketing by interrupting people isn’t cost-effective anymore. You can’t afford to seek out people and send them unwanted marketing messages, in large groups, and hope that some will send you money. Instead, the future belongs to marketers who establish a foundation and process where interested people can market to each other. Ignite consumer networks and then get out of the way and let them talk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let them talk. Or, blog.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever run into someone taken by power that they will do anything to hold onto it? I have. Several times in my career in education, I have had to work in organizations with people that power had corrupted, or as Ryan puts it, &ldquo;stained purple.&rdquo; For whatever the reason, something changes in the character of the person, and they are willing to do whatever they have to. Whatever they have to, not to help others, but to control them, to bend them to their will, to say, &ldquo;I know the best way forward, and we won&rsquo;t listen to anyone else because I know best.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="power-corrupts">Power Corrupts</h2>
<p>I love this excerpt from Ryan Holiday&rsquo;s enewsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take care that thou art not made into a Caesar, that thou art not dyed with this dye.” In The Daily Stoic, we have Marcus express his worry of being “stained purple.” Ok, but what is he actually talking about? He’s talking about being corrupted by power, changed by the position and fame that he has. And we know this was a lifelong concern of his. One story has Marcus Aurelius breaking down in tears when he’s told he will someday be emperor, not because he was sad, but because his study of history taught him how few people managed to leave the job unscathed, let alone unchanged. <strong>(Source: <a href="https://dailystoic.com/whatever-you-call-it-steer-clear/">Email 3/2/24 via Ryan Holiday, Whatever You Call It, Steer Clear</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holiday makes some more excellent points in this piece, but I have to ask myself, &ldquo;When I had power to make others do what I thought right, did I allow myself to be corrupted by power?&rdquo; At a time when so many institutions and individuals wield tremendous power over our lives, it seems to easy to let oneself be seduced by the constant modeling around us.</p>
<h2 id="if-they-do-it-why-not-me">If They Do It, Why Not Me?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if, if we see others wielding tremendous power, when it&rsquo;s our turn to hold the scepter, we use it in the same way. After all, it&rsquo;s the right way, isn&rsquo;t it? My examples come mostly from K-12 school districts, where you see some superintendent or CTO do things a certain way, not because it&rsquo;s the right way negotiated with stakeholders, but because it&rsquo;s what they see as making their jobs easier or the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; from their perspective.</p>
<p>The older I get, I see how easy it is to do this. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve made a decision to NOT exercise institutional authority or claim organizational power. How do you wield influence without authority?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="influence-without-authority">Influence Without Authority</h2>
<p>Consider this quote about <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Without-Authority-Allan-Cohen/dp/0471463302">the book of the same title</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>influence is not purely dependent on positional authority, but rather on individuals' skills, knowledge, relationships, and personal attributes. . .influence is most effective when it is built on a foundation of trust and mutual respect. They provide readers with practical strategies for developing strong relationships, fostering collaboration, and creating win-win situations. <strong>(<a href="https://www.bookey.app/quote-book/influence-without-authority">source</a>)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perspective I agree with wholeheartedly and wish I&rsquo;d know more about, truly understood it is this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best leaders are those who can influence others without relying on their position or title. True power lies in your ability to positively impact those around you, regardless of your formal authority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, as a young person, my focus was on getting institutional authority because it paid better. What I should have been doing better, spent more time on, valued more highly was learning how to positively impact the lives of others. But I missed that lesson growing up. It almost seems a bit late to start learning and practicing it now&hellip;but it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be happy to know, Doug, this isn&rsquo;t a dead horse.&rdquo; Over at The Blue Skunk blog, Doug &ldquo;Old Timer&rdquo; Johnson, quotes someone who asks, &ldquo;Is blogging dead?&rdquo; (paraphrase). Doug writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Blue Skunk was started in 2005 as what I thought would be a very temporary experiment. (I honestly didn&rsquo;t know at the time I named the blog &ldquo;Blue Skunk&rdquo; that it was a brand of marijuana -really, I didn&rsquo;t!) I wondered if blogging was &ldquo;my thing&rdquo; since I was writing articles and columns and had even published a book or few. But I quickly came to find it a tool as Mark describes it, to &ldquo;capture my thoughts&rdquo; and clarify my thinking. And having no shame, share my conclusions without editors or censorship or occasionally good judgement. (See Why the Blue Skunk Blog and Why I Write for Professional Publication) for a bit more thoughtful approach to my writing.) Writing this blog has probably given me more joy than it has given my readers.
(<strong>Source: <a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2018/1/8/is-the-blog-dead.html">The Blue Skunk Blog- Is The Blog Dead?</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might imagine, in the case of my own blog, it&rsquo;s not dead. It&rsquo;s still alive somewhere, but now, I get to give it another go. Perhaps Doug&rsquo;s most apt observation is this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing this blog has probably given me more joy than it has given my readers&hellip;If blogging or just the Blue Skunk is a dead horse, it is one I will continue to beat. Sorry about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a long-time education blogger, that&rsquo;s exactly right on target for me. Thinking and sharing ideas IS too much fun. I hope that a new blog space will revitalize my own. Some days, you have to burn the place down, scatter the ashes, and plant anew.</p>

<p>Earlier this year (2024), I had the chance to facilitate a workshop on a topic I&rsquo;d spent a LONG time reading about and researching. I felt ignorant about it, so much so that I started out studying logic, what constituted logical fallacies, types of bias, and more. It was great because I was finally learning about something I&rsquo;d ignored or done as little as I could over the years. Maybe I did that because it was uncomfortable, hard, and a pain.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="engaged-in-an-activity">Engaged in an Activity</h2>
<p>But a lifetime of experience made me want to explore this all the more. Critical thinking, I&rsquo;ve found, is a bit like writing. If you&rsquo;re not engaged in the activity, you&rsquo;re not a writer or thinker. Fortunately, writing is one way that critical thinking can be done, and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done for years. Of course, I still mess up. One way I did was how I went about setting up this blog.</p>
<h2 id="the-sword-of-damocles">The Sword of Damocles</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with this story. Impending doom hangs over your head by a thread. In my case, it&rsquo;s the fact that I moved my <a href="http://www.mguhlin.org">www.mguhlin.org</a> to point to mguhlin.micro.blog, but in my effort to clean out content, I nuked the micro.blog it was pointing to. Not once, but twice. I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t have acted on that impulse that said, &ldquo;Do it&hellip;do it now!&rdquo; while watching television on the couch after a day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m waiting for my <a href="http://www.mguhlin.org">www.mguhlin.org</a> to point at a website that doesn&rsquo;t exist. Let&rsquo;s hope that will be easy to recover from.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve fixed the issue with a new domain (mgblog.org) that points to my new site, mguhlin.microblog.org. We&rsquo;ll see if it works. But it&rsquo;s obvious that some System 2 thinking should have taken place. I probably could have written everything down to see if this was the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="critical-thinking-processes">Critical Thinking Processes</h2>
<p>In spite of knowing about several critical thinking processes, I skipped them all to do what I wanted. I went with my first impulse and that wasn&rsquo;t a wise choice. I&rsquo;m looking forward to thinking things through a bit more. Look before you leap, of course.</p>

<h2 id="finding-answers-together">Finding Answers Together</h2>
<p>One of the courses or sessions I facilitate for K-12 CTOs and technology directors focuses on professional learning networks (PLNs). But what are PLNs these days? Are they where you hang out on social media, like LinkedIn, TikTok, or Facebook? Maybe Clubhouse or Instagram is your thing. What bugs me about those is the idea that they are simply platforms. These commercial platforms make me ask, &ldquo;What are we creating this content for? How are we building a community of learners, practitioners, and leaders that thinks through answers to questions?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A PLN is a network of connections that educators create and engage in aimed at enhancing their professional development (PD). PLNs provide <strong>great spaces for teachers to exchange ideas, collaborate and share resources</strong>, and engage in meaningful discussions about teaching practices and trends in education. <strong>Source: <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/professional-learning-networks-teachers">Rachelle Dene Poth, Building Your PLN, Edutopia</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teachers today, same as CTOs, have ample places and spaces to do that. When I first started blogging, I was exploring the areas of personal and professional learning networks, trying to better understand them. As I start this new blog, I have to ask myself, &ldquo;Is it mission accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not to keep up with colleagues, or achieve social media notoriety, but rather to keep up with the shift in the way all people will approach learning as the digital divide begins to close at an ever-increasing rate.

</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-indeed">Why, indeed?</h2>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not mission accomplished. Back in 2016, when I started my post-K-12 school district work in a non-profit education association, I realized that I had fallen into a trap of thinking, &ldquo;I know a lot. There&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun.&rdquo; It took some time to re-adjust my furled sails, and put myself in the position of becoming a &ldquo;lifelong learner&rdquo; <em>again</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every teacher needs to improve, not because they are not good enough, but because they can be even better.” - Dylan Wiliam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m doing that again with the launch of this blog that is narrowly focused on five key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> I&rsquo;m simultaneously enamored of AI and horrified at the impact on people and the environment.</li>
<li><strong>MyNotes</strong>: This is where I&rsquo;ll be focusing my efforts on critical thinking processes, and sharing what I read.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong>: I will probably share anything interesting that doesn&rsquo;t fall into &ldquo;work related&rdquo; type category</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy</strong>: As I&rsquo;ve grown older, &ldquo;awakened&rdquo; to the injustices and history, I find myself reaching for ideas and guiding principles that precede the religion I was taught growing up. I have decided to forgive myself for not &ldquo;waking up&rdquo; from the fantasy of false history and religion.  I want to learn more about other ways of thinking that are not supernatural, and be fearless in the face of preternatural threats the religious might level at me.</li>
<li><strong>Professional</strong>: I can&rsquo;t help myself, I want to write about work stuff and I realize now that trying to keep these ideas separate simply because they might make someone uncomfortable is silly. I will try to be respectful as I can be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for joining me in this journey. Let&rsquo;s see where we end up.</p>
<h2 id="oh-one-more-thing">Oh, One More Thing</h2>
<p>My other blog, where I&rsquo;ve been writing for over 15 years, is Around the Corner. The idea was, go around the corner even if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s there. And, that was appropriate back then because I didn&rsquo;t know what the heck I was getting into with all the new edtech coming at me. I still remember the panic attack I suffered on the way to work when I realized, &ldquo;Dude, you&rsquo;re SO ignorant.&rdquo; My way out of that was to start learning and blogging.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that sense of anxiety now. That&rsquo;s why, after taking stock of what I &ldquo;know&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I realize it&rsquo;s all silly worries for me to have now. This blog is &ldquo;Another Think Coming.&rdquo; What does that mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To have &lsquo;another think coming&rsquo; is to be greatly mistaken. The phrase is usually spoken by an antagonist as &lsquo;you have another think coming&rsquo;; the implication being that <em>one will shortly be obliged to adopt a different viewpoint</em>, either by the presentation of indisputable evidence, or b_ force. (<strong>Source: <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/another-think-coming.html">Phrases</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. It&rsquo;s to remind me that new evidence will probably force me to adopt a different viewpoint. Bring it on.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Here are the results of an AI application of The Orwell Test to my <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2024/02/pay-for-student-performance.html">previous blog entry</a></strong>:</p>
<h2 id="applying-the-orwell-test-to-outcomes-based-contracting-in-education">Applying The Orwell Test to Outcomes-Based Contracting in Education</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To apply The Orwell Test to the concept of outcomes-based contracting (OBC) in education, we must examine the facts, source, and method related to the implementation and reporting of OBC.</p>
<h3 id="facts">Facts</h3>
<p>Outcomes-based contracting in education is a strategy where payments to service providers are contingent upon achieving specific student outcomes. This approach is designed to focus on results rather than just service delivery, with the intention of improving student achievement and ensuring that investments in education yield tangible benefits[1][4][6][10][14][15][18][21][22][23]. The facts surrounding OBC are supported by evidence from pilot programs and studies that have been conducted to assess its effectiveness[1][4][6][10][14][15][18][21][22][23].</p>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>The information about OBC comes from a variety of sources, including academic institutions, educational foundations, and research organizations. For instance, the Southern Education Foundation (SEF) is actively involved in promoting and supporting OBC initiatives[14][15][18][21][22][23]. The credibility of these sources is generally high, as they are organizations with expertise in education policy and practice[1][4][6][10][14][15][18][21][22][23].</p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>The method of reporting on OBC involves the collection and analysis of data from pilot programs and research studies. These methods are professional and accepted techniques of factual reporting. The studies and reports often discuss both the potential benefits and the challenges or drawbacks of OBC, indicating a balanced approach to the subject[1][4][6][10][14][15][18][21][22][23]. There is no indication of deceptive tactics or logical fallacies in the presentation of information about OBC.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Based on The Orwell Test, outcomes-based contracting in education appears to be a well-founded concept with information provided by credible sources and reported through professional methods. There is no immediate reason to be highly suspicious of the information presented on this topic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>When watching evangelicals on television, listening to incessant political adds of 2024, I am often reminded what theologian Dick Westley calls &ldquo;religion vs faith&rdquo; conversation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from his book, <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/redemptiveintima00west/page/50/mode/1up">Redemptive Intimacy</a></em>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For many evangelicals, it seems Christianity is a religion rather than faith, where people are told what to do by an angry God from a holy text that can&rsquo;t be changed.</p>
<p>Even though religion and a literal interpretation of the Bible is a reflection of flawed understanding of our relationship with God. And in that flawed understanding, all sorts of bad things are possible yet blessed by God because that &ldquo;god&rdquo; is our made-up version of Him.</p>
<p>Whew. In other words, if you act in the ways listed above, blaming it on god, that is a god of your own making.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been sort of obvious why some would want people to believe in an angry God. The big, bad god is going to smite you if you don&rsquo;t adhere to what he says you must do, and, of course, I have a keen insight into what that is.</p>
<p>This is a way of controlling others, instead of assisting people figure out what God wants in their lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-divine-punisher">The Divine Punisher</h2>
<p>You can see some of how the idea idea of punishing God who inflicts plagues and disasters on bad people is scary, right? But I see us as needing to push back on this idea of the angry Divine Punisher who is wiping us out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really old-fashioned idea from when we didn&rsquo;t have better ways to explain why and how illnesses, diseases, and disasters come from.</p>
<p>Christianity is much more than just an explanation for bad things happening to people. And, there are better explanations ground in science.</p>
<p>Any god you want to worship should be more than just a caricature of our basest beliefs. Unfortunately, many believers see it as their right to ignore scientific fact, and justify it with their religious beliefs, their conception of a god who can keep them safe, who brings order to the world. Since their beliefs are not falsifiable, they can&rsquo;t be proven or disproven.</p>
<h2 id="rejecting-ideas">Rejecting Ideas</h2>
<p>The following quote was helpful to me when I was younger. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have stumbled onto Theologian Dick Westley. He puts it this way in his book, <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/redemptiveintima00west/page/50/mode/1up">Redemptive Intimacy</a></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>God does not punish, if He ever did, people and nations with bad things. Rather, when people and nations engage in actions out of alignment with His will, bad things happen, not because He is smiting them, but rather because these are troubles we bring upon ourselves. Simply, human beings are allowed to own the consequences of their own actions (or the actions of others).</li>
<li>The End Times are not for individuals, prayer groups, or any one group to predict or bring about because it suits our ends to smite our enemies. Our enemies will do their best to hurt us, and we will do our best to defend ourselves because we live in the world, not in heaven.</li>
<li>An omniscient God must know that we no longer live in Eden. Instead, we live in a dangerous space where our only solace are those who rise up and welcome his Spirit of lovingness and forgiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not found a more clear rejection of god as a divine punisher.</p>
<h2 id="the-drowning-man">The Drowning Man</h2>
<p>One of my favorite stories reminds me that if something good is going to be done, you better get to doing it yourself or ask for help from another human being. Counting on &ldquo;hope, prayer&rdquo; is not an evidence-based approach.
If hope and prayers worked, we would have seen a lot less violence against humans. Any belief system that justifies human suffering and death as a sacrifice to an angry god, well, is crazy to me.</p>
<h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, &ldquo;I had faith in you but you didn&rsquo;t save me, you let me drown. I don&rsquo;t understand why!&rdquo;
To this God replied, &ldquo;I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, it reminds me of Matthew 4:7-10, &ldquo;Do not put the Lord your God to the test.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s an <strong><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/test-God.html">interesting explanation</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Jesus was in peril, God would have to save Him. Jesus refused to test God in such a way. We are to accept God’s Word by faith, without requiring a sign (see Luke 11:29). God’s promises are there for us when we need them; to manipulate situations in an attempt to coerce God into fulfilling His promises is evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If human beings live in fear of God, their greatest fears may very well be apostasy and this quote from Jesus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine what children might reject the Gospel, their belief in the Christ, because their parents rejected vaccinations and masking in schools? What a terrible example we are setting.</p>
<h2 id="fear">Fear</h2>
<p>People are dying, have been dying, and there is a bit of panic among Christians. It is the sort of panic that is strange, because the panic isn&rsquo;t about dying necessarily, but rather the embrace of a plague.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is plague, it is inconsequential. If it is consequential, it is to be dealt with with prayer and faith, not human means. If human means are insufficient, if God doesn&rsquo;t intercede, then it is a sign of the end times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that most American Christians are vaccinated against a host of diseases at birth, including (with their baptism) against the lies and snares of the Devil, I am disappointed at the reaction to COVID-19. That reaction includes efforts of Anti-vaccination, anti-masking, yelling and screaming, threatening violence to educators and withholding funding.</p>
<h3 id="fear-science-will-prove-god-doesnt-exist">Fear Science Will Prove God Doesn&rsquo;t Exist</h3>
<p>Science is the best tool humans have at understanding objective reality in spite of themselves. If you accept God exists, you realize that there is BIG possibility that you lack the capacity to comprehend Him. If you don&rsquo;t accep God exists, you also accept that you are basing your lack of belief on a narrow sliver of the reality you understand based on imperfect evidence&hellip;and that this evidence may change in the future.</p>
<p>Either way, I discount human&rsquo;s religious beliefs about God. I suggest we may be too limited to grasp it. Like broken vessels, we gotta capture what evidence about the world we can, understanding there is a vastness to it all that is beyond our grasp at this time.</p>
<h3 id="salon-article">Salon Article</h3>
<p>I found this Salon.com piece worthwhile meditation this past weekend. It is entitled, &ldquo;<em><strong><a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/08/28/evangelicals-science-and-the-vaccine-refusal-is-built-on-deep-seated-fear/">Evangelicals, science and the vaccine: Refusal is built on deep-seated fear</a></strong></em>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Darwin to COVID the church has been wrong. It&rsquo;s really about fear among the Christian faithful when they turn away from science. Even scientific theory is dismissed out of hand by the church because of a fear that<strong>somehow science will prove that God does not exist</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the pandemic spreads from one church to another and global warming continues to be ignored by the evangelical movement, it is clear that practitioners of the current Christian faith have not evolved from their ancestors who condemned Galileo and Darwin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That science will have anything to say about God, immanent and transcendent, is laughable. But Science does have a lot to say about our current situation, the physical world we live in. I found the author&rsquo;s points spot on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing to fear from scientific data and proper research. There is something to fear from the fearful and ignorant. Anyone who is not willing to question their own belief structure, or anyone that remains in their own echo chamber, is dangerous. That is why there is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is expressing the fear of people who claim to have none. It must be addressed, but that will not be easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider <strong><a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1541/religious-responses-to-the-black-death/">religious responses to the Black Death.</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A final note:</strong> This reflects my current thinking on the matter. I could be wrong about many aspects of what I&rsquo;ve written here.</p>

			 <p>These are my notes on <a href="https://www.powerfulteaching.org/"><em><strong>Powerful Teaching</strong></em></a>. I&rsquo;d like to say I finished the book, but I only made it 3/4ths of the way through before I ran out of time. I may add more content below, but these are my big take-aways. I still have a bit more to add to these notes, but since I almost lost my notes (I was playing with <a href="http://Dillinger.io"><strong>Dillinger.io</strong></a> Markdown Editor (a great Markdown editor that saves your work to cloud storage of choice, but <a href="http://stackedit.io/"><strong>StackEdit</strong></a> remains my favorite) to transcribe my handwritten notes), I decided I&rsquo;d better post them ASAP. </p>
<p>This was a great book on four powerful teaching strategies. It&rsquo;s well worth it to master their usage in K-Adult classrooms. </p>
<h1 id="four-powerful-teaching-strategies">Four Powerful Teaching Strategies</h1>
<p>There are four powerful strategies that boost student learning. These include the following:</p>
<h2 id="1-retrieval-practice">1-Retrieval Practice</h2>
<p>This strategy occurs when learners recall and apply multiple examples of previously learned knowledge or skills after a period of forgetting.</p>
<ul>
<li>It boosts learning by pulling information out of students’ heads (e.g. quizzes/flashcards)</li>
<li>It works by enabling students to practice bringing information forward to remember it better.</li>
<li>Helps students remember what to transfer</li>
<li>Learning strategy, not assessment strategy</li>
<li>Retrieval practice boosts transfer learning</li>
<li>Students do better when they are quizzed versus not quizzed, as much as 13% more.</li>
<li>Provide a mix of fact-based and HOTS retrieval</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions are as, or more effective than short answer questions</li>
<li>Writing down works better than concept mapping for retrieval practice</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="retrieval-practice-activities">Retrieval Practice Activities</h2>
<h3 id="brain-dumpsfree-recall">Brain Dumps/Free Recall</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pause lesson, lecture</li>
<li>Write down everything you can remember</li>
<li>Continue lesson</li>
<li>Ask students to swap Brain Dump with a peer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Then, do a Think-Pair-Share:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there eanything in common that both of us wrote down?</li>
<li>Anything new that neither of us wrote down?</li>
<li>Any misinformation?</li>
<li>Why do you think you remembered what you did?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-things">Two Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pause lesson</li>
<li>Ask, “What are two things you learned yesterday? Today?”</li>
<li>Ask, “What are two things you’d like to learn more about?”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retrieve-taking">Retrieve-Taking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pause lesson</li>
<li>Students write down what they want to study</li>
<li>Give feedback on what they wrote</li>
<li>Continue with lesson</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="daily-miniquizzes">Daily MiniQuizzes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Formulate questions</li>
<li>Put clues on slips of paper</li>

<li>Retrieve and write down information in Retrieval Guide</li>
<li>Think-Pair-Share</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-spaced-practice-or-spacing">2-Spaced Practice or spacing</h3>
<p>Boosts learning by spreading lessons and retrieval opportunities over time so learning isn’t crammed all at once.</p>
<h3 id="3-interleaving">3-Interleaving</h3>
<p>Mixes up related topics and encourages discrimination.</p>
<h3 id="4-feedback">4-Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provides student opportunity to know what they know, and know what they don’t know</li>
<li>This increases students’ meta-cognition or understanding their learning progress.</li>
<li>Helps students apply knowledge correctly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-strategies">Benefits of Strategies</h2>
<p>Research shows that there are various benefits. These include</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance higher order thinking skills and knowledge transfer</li>
<li>Raise student achievement by a letter grade or two</li>
<li>Boosts learning for diverse students and subject areas</li>
<li>Increases use of effective study of strategies out of class</li>
<li>Improves mental organization of knowledge</li>

<li>Identifies gaps in students’ knowledge</li>
<li>Increases meta-cognition and awareness of learning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stages-of-learning">Stages of Learning</h2>
<p>There are several stages of learning. These include the following:</p>
<h3 id="1-encoding">1-Encoding</h3>
<p>When we meet information for the first time, or initially learn something.</p>
<h3 id="2-storage">2-Storage</h3>
<p>Keeping encoded information and how long it is retained.</p>
<h3 id="3-retrieval">3-Retrieval</h3>
<p>When we reach back and bring out of our minds the information we previously learned. When we access information and bring it to mind.</p>
<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>
<h3 id="social-emotional-learning">Social-Emotional Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Investigates how we interact with the world around us, or what happens outside our heads.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Looking for an easy way to introduce students to CER, or Claim Evidence Reasoning approach? You may want to check out Scott Phillips slim text, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WRITING-MIDDLE-SCHOOL-SCIENCE-Reasoning-ebook/dp/B07B2LCW2V">Writing in Middle School Science: Claim, Evidence, Reasoning Papers That Work</a></em>, part of his <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GPFD57?binding=kindle_edition&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn">Primal Teaching Series of books</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The Amazon book jacket reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you frustrated your middle school science students can’t write? Whether you call them Claim, Evidence, Reasoning (CER) or Conclusions Based on Data (CBDs), seemingly all science teachers struggle with student writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This simple six-sentence, step-by-step, one-day lesson allows students to produce fantastic work in minutes. You’ll grade each paper in seconds and truly know who understands the material and who does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Author Scott Phillips spent ten years perfecting “Writing in Middle School Science” while teaching sixth, seventh and eighth grades. He’s been called the father of “Primal Teaching” and understands that if ideas are not easy and simple, teachers won’t use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Phillips often says, “It has to work 100 percent of the time with 100 percent of my students, or I won’t teach it.” And this book delivers a proven strategy that works. His students write 60 to 90 papers each year and complete them (with grades) in under 5 minutes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott does a wonderful job of sharing examples of CER and how he has used it with students. If you need a primer on CER, this book is it. Scott claims to use CERs on the four to five most important ideas or principles from any major section. He uses CERs in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>warms ups at the beginning of class * tests and quizzes</li>
</ul>
<p>He gives students full credit for a completed CER if &ldquo;sentence six is right and the principle used is correct.&rdquo; Sentence six, as you&rsquo;ll see in a moment, focuses on the conclusion.</p>
<p>One added benefit? It&rsquo;s free.</p>
<h2 id="free-via-amazon-kindle-unlimited">Free via Amazon Kindle Unlimited</h2>
<p>Well, not exactly free. You have to have a Kindle Unlimited account on Amazon to get it at no cost. Since I did, I was pleasantly surprised to have it pop up as a counterpoint to all the RPGLit (or is it LitRPG? Who knows, they are fun to read) stories that Amazon has been suggesting lately.</p>
<h2 id="about-scotts-secret-structure">About Scott&rsquo;s Secret Structure</h2>
<p>I found the info that Scott provides his students as a handout quite helpful. He put it in an appendix and for me it&rsquo;s the formula I needed. I&rsquo;m sure his students did as well (and yours, too!).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentence 1:</strong> Answer the question</li>
<li><strong>Sentences 2,3,4:</strong> Convert data from number format into sentence format. Exclude unimportant data.</li>
<li><strong>Sentence 5:</strong> Start with &ldquo;In science, we know&hellip;&rdquo; then state the scientific principle that supports your answer.</li>
<li><strong>Sentence 6:</strong> Summarize data then write &ldquo;Therefore&rdquo; and summarize your answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also offers these suggestions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid writing more than six sentences and do not use the word &ldquo;because.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the examples really make this book valuable. I know you can use Google search to find a ton of CER examples, but Scott makes this really simple&hellip;simple enough for a middle school student to follow, which is about the level I am at anyways in these tough concepts.</p>
<p>;-)</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s book is replete with examples, not only perfect examples but ones students that are learning a second language may be coming up with. This makes it a great book to use when modeling CER construction with students.</p>
<p>In his example, he shares a question: &ldquo;Will the ball sink in water?&rdquo; At this point, Scott shares the density of three items, such as the ball (1.5g/ml), water (1.0 g/ml), and corn (0.25 g/ml). Of course, I found this a little confusing. I realized that my science experiences had only told me that something heavier than water would sink, not the specifics of density.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An Aside:</strong> And, that&rsquo;s what has made me want to go back and re-read all my science books and information. I hadn&rsquo;t ever thought of scientific principles in this way. I am appalled at my science education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott says the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) would be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, the ball will sink.</li>
<li>The density of the ball is 1.5 g/ml</li>
<li>The density of water is 1.0 g/ml</li>
<li>In science, we know that a more dense object will sink in a less dense material.</li>
<li>The ball is more dense than water, therefore it sinks.  (extraneous info about corn&rsquo;s density isn&rsquo;t included in the reasoning)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scott points out that you could write the sentence in paragraph form. For example, if the question is adjusted to read, &ldquo;Which of these objects will sink or float in the water?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, some objects will sink and others will float. The density of the water is 1.0 g/ml, while the density of the ball is 1.5 g/ml and the corn&rsquo;s 0.25 g/ml. In science, we know that more dense objects (ball) sink while less dense objects (corn) float atop the less dense material (water).  Given that the ball is more dense, and the corn is less dense, than water therefore the ball will sink and the corn will float.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but this is quite comforting to have a scientific principle to point to and say, &ldquo;This will happen as a result because this principle is in play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a great book, providing insight into something that can be a real obstacle for students. And, CER appears to work great in other content areas.</p>
<h2 id="cer-in-social-studies">CER IN SOCIAL STUDIES</h2>
<p>Imagine if everyone used CER more often. I suppose the question that bugs me about applying it to history and real life is, &ldquo;What principles provide the truth as a guidepost, like they do in science?&rdquo; To find out, I decided to take a look at some examples, <strong><a href="http://www.survivingsocialstudies.com/blog/cer-claim-evidence-and-reasoning-in-social-studies-the-boston-massacre-trial-for-middle-school">like this one</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.survivingsocialstudies.com/blog/cer-claim-evidence-and-reasoning-in-social-studies-the-boston-massacre-trial-for-middle-school">See image at Surviving Social Studies blog</a></p>
<p>Reading this makes me want to apply CER to a more recent event, such as the January 6th Insurrection. Since the question of whether it was an insurrection or not continues to be in doubt for some folks, how would you approach it using CER?</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Was the January 6th gathering of people an insurrection or attack on the U.S. Capitol?</p>
<p>Ok, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentence 1:</strong> Yes, the people who gathered on January 6th, 2021 killed Capitol police and injured others in their attempt to halt the certification of Democrat&rsquo;s Joe biden&rsquo;s victory in the Electoral College.</li>
<li><strong>Sentences 2,3,4:</strong> Evidence suggests the following:</li>
<li>Premeditation was evident given how organizers and participants showed up with weapons and protective gear.</li>
<li>Individuals at the event worked together to breach the Capitol to stop certification of Biden&rsquo;s victory, killing and maiming Capitol police in the process, as well as damaging property.</li>
<li>False information about the outcome of the presidential election had been shared by then President Trump and those working with him to overturn the results.</li>
<li><strong>Sentence 5:</strong> In law, we know that when someone commits a series of unlawful violent acts in concert with others to stop a legal, government process (i.e. certification of the Electoral College votes), that is the definition of an insurrection.</li>
<li><strong>Sentence 6:</strong> Therefore, the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol constitutes an insurrection, or revolt, against the lawful authority of the United States. I didn&rsquo;t include news article citations for the evidence, but I would in an academic situation with students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Scott!</p>
<h2 id="cerca-method">CERCA Method</h2>
<p>While reading up on applications of CER in Social Studies, I stumbled on the <strong><a href="https://www.thinkcerca.com/cerca">CERCA method</a></strong>. It defines itself <strong><a href="https://www.thinkcerca.com/cerca">in this way</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CERCA Framework is a scaffolded approach to literacy that helps students develop their critical thinking skills. ThinkCERCA’s expert-designed lessons walk students through the process of analyzing content-rich texts and multimedia to construct cohesive argumentative, informational, or narrative writings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CERCA method starts with an essential question, then a recursive process where</p>
<ol>
<li>Claim is developed;</li>
<li>Evidence is sought to support claim;</li>
<li>Reasoning that has students connecting evidence to their claim and reasoning;</li>
<li>Counterargument where other points of view are considered and reviewed for strength/validity. Then, once the 4 steps are exhausted, students consider their audience and craft a conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Definitely worth exploring!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today, we must realize that schools are under attack by Christian Nationalists that are doing their best to control and destroy democracy in the United States of America. They have launched their attack and democracy can&rsquo;t count on a few well-placed Democrats in the White House to do it all.</p>
<p>It is clear that many Americans have been swayed by the pseudo-religious, pseudo-Christian babble spouted by so-called evangelists. Like the author, I have complained to my wife and others that they are in the spirit of the antichrist. Heresies and blasphemies. It seems the contradictions between the Gospel and what is said to be of the Gospel reveal ignorance or willful deception.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sharing my notes on reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christians-Against-Christianity-Right-Wing-Evangelicals-ebook/dp/B08KSQ7K1B/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Christians Against Christianity: How Right-Wing Evangelicals Are Destroying Our Nation and Our Faith</a></em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Obery Hendricks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hendricks does a fantastic job refuting from a Christian perspective all the terrible garbage, the &ldquo;rotten fruit&rdquo; of right-wing evangelicals pushing Christian nationalism.</p>
<p>As I read his book, I found myself asking myself a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is power and wealth such a powerful inducement to pervert the Gospel message?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have believers lost hope in the Gospel that they want temporal power people like Trump and his sycophants have to offer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What ignorant believers have swallowed these lies in their churches?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many who might have believed in Christ will fall away or turn away because of this?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe in the Adversary working to trick people into turning away from a Supreme Being, then you have stumbled into the dystopian reality that is America, perhaps from as <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/11/audible-1619-project.html?q=1619+project">far back as 1619</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is disappointing stuff. In the last few months, I have often asked myself, would we be better off without the influence of Christian believers? So much so that these words come to mind (well, they came to mind after I saw them in a tweet):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Religion is regarded by the common people as true**, by the wise as false, and** <em>by rulers as useful</em>**.” **</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>-Attributed to Seneca, but may be a rewrite of the words of Edward Gibbon (1776)(Chapter II: The Internal Prosperity In The Age Of The Antonines.—Part I. Second Paragraph</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who said it or when. It is a bit cynical but accurate, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?</p>
<p>&ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t need our belief to ensure His reign,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve thought of late as I see Republicans scrambling to do just that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>-James Madison, 1803</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it had to end some time. :-(</p>
<h2 id="mynotes">MyNotes</h2>
<p>This is a powerful book, and here are a few select quotes. You&rsquo;ll want to read the entire text yourself, but these are quotes that were stunning and/or affirmed the problem we&rsquo;re in now. I found Hendricks organization of the text as a powerful way to debunk ideas that have entered popular culture.</p>
<p>I confess the abortion chapter set my own beliefs straight on the matter. My position has shifted from when I was seventeen years old and I was taught abortion was murder.</p>
<p>My daughter put it to me as, &ldquo;Abortion is a healthcare issue and shouldn&rsquo;t be denied to women.&rdquo; No matter what crazy examples you find (e.g. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/03/ohio-indiana-abortion-rape-victim">10 year old girl being forced to travel from Ohio to Indiana to have an abortion</a></strong> because she was raped but Ohio law prohibits her from having an abortion), a part of me will always see abortion as problematic.</p>
<p>Human life is precious, even unborn. But, it&rsquo;s not my decision to make. If a women must have an abortion, then let that be her decision and God, if He so chooses, may hold her accountable. I&rsquo;d rather not get involved in that decision. Hendricks makes some powerful points on this topic.</p>
<p>I have only included a few quotes that I wanted to revisit in the future. You will definitely want to read the entire book to better see the case he makes for each topic.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dominion Over America</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;In a November 2016 post on the Billy Graham Association website, Franklin Graham maintained that there is a divine call for a “Christian revolution in America” that will place control &hellip;in the hands of right-wing evangelical Christians&hellip;Pat Robertson declared outright that “God’s plan for His people . . . is to take dominion&hellip;Lordship. He wants His people to reign and rule with Him.”&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repulsive Religion</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The abolitionist Frederick Douglass, in “<strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/09/periphery-of-memory-mynotes-word-word.html?q=douglass">What to a Slave Is the Fourth of July?</a></strong>,” his famous July 5, 1852, oration at Corinthian Hall in Rochester, New York, indicted the Christian church of his day:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“These ministers . . . strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. <strong>It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs</strong>. It is not that ‘pure and undefiled religion’ which is from above.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Racist</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob Jones University argued that separation of the races was God’s will, and thus it should be allowed to continue its “God ordained” segregationist ways without government penalty. The school became a cause célèbre for right-wing evangelicals, and its defiance against the government’s ruling a defining moment for the movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite its claim to be guided by divine will, in actuality Bob Jones University was a virulently racist institution and an active proponent of white supremacist practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For [Jerry] Falwell, integration was “the work of the devil.” “The true negro,” he contended, “does not want integration. He realizes his potential is far better among his own race.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Tea Party rallies, Obama was burned in effigy hanging from a noose, depicted as an “African witch doctor” replete with a bone in his nose and as a mugger holding Uncle Sam in a chokehold, and told to “go home to Kenya” in handheld sign after sign. Even his wife and daughters were subjected to racial slurs and insults. The air at Tea Party gatherings was thick with chants of “We want our country back!” and “Give us our country back!”—as if America had been overrun by a foreign invader. Tea Party doyenne and former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin epitomized those sentiments with her charge that Obama “is not one of us.”26 Black members of Congress were even spat upon and called derisive racial epithets at Tea Party rallies.27</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump’s evangelicals carried a pernicious message directly counter to the faith they profess: that it is acceptable to commit transgressions of virtually any kind against other human beings simply because their skin bears a different hue or they speak in unfamiliar tongues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dogmatism</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-wing evangelicals’ complicity in Trump’s debasement of American society shamefully paints the Christian Gospel of light, love, and egalitarian justice as an ugly, loveless, exclusionary ideology of domination. Jesus said that each of us will be known by the fruit of our acts and attitudes. The rot of the unholy fruit of Trump’s evangelical supporters and apologists has spread across the length and breadth of this nation, portraying evil as good and good as evil. That is their vile and blasphemous harvest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for evangelicals, anyone who does not condemn same-gender-loving people, oppose a woman’s right of sovereignty over her own body, or reject the government’s responsibility to care for the welfare of those in need is not a worthy person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet nowhere did Jesus suggest dogmatic religious litmus tests as necessary requirements for following him, or even for going to heaven; not once in his Gospel pronouncements does he say that God would judge anyone based upon adherence to any particular creed. In fact, in the entirety of the gospels he says virtually nothing about what to believe. What he did teach were ethical precepts about serving and honoring God by treating our neighbors in ways consistent with the just and loving will of God or, as I have articulated it elsewhere, treating the people’s needs as holy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Idol State</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right-wing evangelicals have chosen to make an idol of the American state. They chose to elevate to near-messianic status an immoral, dishonest, functionally non-Christian man as president of the United States. In doing so, right-wing evangelicals have militated against the foundational social justice imperative of the very Bible they claim to hold so dear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Homosexuality:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nowhere in the four gospels does Jesus speak of homosexuality or make any statement that can even be construed as alluding to it. And when Paul’s few apparent references to homosexuality are examined in their original koine Greek language and for their function in Paul’s theology and call to discipleship, exactly what he has in mind is not clear. The same with the handful of Old Testament passages that seem to prescribe death for all men everywhere and in every age who engage in homosexual relations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we have considered every passage in the Bible that is used to condemn same-sex intimacy as a sin. But no matter how one understands this handful of passages, no matter what they believe, nothing gives anyone the right to make gay men and women objects of hatred, ridicule, violence, and exclusion. Such mistreatment of anyone, no matter who they might be, violates to its very depths the Gospel’s call to love and care for one another. That is to say that no one can demonize homosexual people and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ too. The two are mutually exclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Immigration</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of right-wing evangelicals’ professed regard for the Bible, with its ubiquity of admonitions to support immigrants, one would expect them to be immigrants’ greatest champions. Instead, they are among immigrants’ greatest foes. Despite their faith claims and supposed fidelity to the Bible, the reality is that with few exceptions right-wing evangelical elites and their followers overwhelmingly support the US government’s inhospitable, inhumane treatment of immigrants that is being waged on a monstrous scale. Apparently, evangelicals’ disdain for people of color and religious “others” trumps even the authority of the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by strategically interpreting the Bible to define fetuses as actual children, evangelical leaders have managed to recast legalized abortion from a theological issue mainly of significance to those who share their beliefs into a looming political issue they characterize as the government-sanctioned murder of children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biblical penalty for causing a pregnant woman to abort a fetus, albeit involuntarily, is a monetary fine, as long as she is otherwise unharmed. But if the woman is seriously injured, the punishment is lex talionis, “eye for eye, tooth for tooth” (Exodus 21:24).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter the claims to the contrary by “pro-life” evangelicals, the difference is indisputable: the lone biblical passage that addresses aborting a fetus states that unborn fetuses and living human beings are to be valued differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, it says that the life of a pregnant woman is more valuable than what is in her womb. Those who argue against abortion even when a woman’s health is at stake seem to overlook this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bottom line is that right-wing evangelicals really are not at all “pro-life” in any large sense. They simply are abortion obsessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guns</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1968, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun-related incidents; this is a higher death count than Americans killed in all US wars combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only do evangelicals wrongly cite the words of Jesus in support of gun ownership, they also ignore scriptural passages that express the divine desire for fewer deadly weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some are so hell-bent on using the biblical witness to support their thirst for guns that they portray Jesus in ridiculous ways to associate his teachings with deadly firearms, as in a popular bumper sticker: “Jesus would still be alive if he’d had an AR-15.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work and Unions</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-wing evangelicals continue to play a major role in the perpetuation of the vast chasm between the rich and the poor by their identification of Christianity with libertarianism, their virtually nonexistent criticism of corporate abuse, and their never-ending attempts to unravel the social safety net that is so crucial to a semblance of decent life for so many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In large part, evangelicals’ unwavering support of the Trump administration furthered the corporate onslaught against unions by scrapping numerous job safety regulations and killing a ruling that extended overtime pay to millions of workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right-wing evangelicals support an unjust status quo of vast disparities between America’s rich and its poor. This is anathema to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and destructive to the fabric of our nation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>As I read Hendrick&rsquo;s book, I am struck again by <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/11/ataraxia.html?q=bertrand+russell">these words below</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was long the case that men would grovel upon the earth,</p>
<p>crushed beneath the weight of Superstition whose head</p>
<p>loomed in the heavens, glaring down with her dreadful visage</p>
<p>until Epicurus of Greece dared to look up and confront her,</p>
<p>taking a stand against the fables and myths of the gods . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest explanation? &ldquo;A disease born of fear and a source of untold misery to the human race.&rdquo; It is a tool to control the masses, to fool them. We have never seen it so plain as we do today, watching Trump, Right-Wing Evangelicals, and Republicans do what they do. All these acts they seek to, and do, perpetrate on human beings is bad enough. But then, they wrap it in the story of Jesus to sanctify it&hellip;as if that story were a common fairy tale.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is. Hendricks book makes it plain that right-wing evangelicals story is a false one, rotten fruit, and we would do best to cut the tree down and burn it all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. (Matthew 7:15-20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I reflect on when I first accepted Christ as a young man in the Student Baptist Union (SBU) in Wichita Falls, Texas, just off the campus of Midwestern State University,  I realize that I did so with the hope that good flowed from a supernatural source. The impersonal nature of Catholic Church rituals seemed less certain to believe in than the warmth of the SBU&rsquo;s interactions.</p>
<p>Now, I realize I was really but a boy alone, looking for companionship and friends. In the end, it is in my nature to be alone, to find my own way. For me, God and the Holy Spirit were not to be wielded as sharp swords and axes to decapitate and maim others like LGBTQ+, women seeking abortion, or people being people, making mistakes and sinning.</p>
<p>It is for that reason that when someone says, &ldquo;God wills it,&rdquo; I know s/he is a liar trying to use God to make money and profit off others' ignorant beliefs and views.</p>
<p>This is a powerful book. Every believer should read it and meditate on it. Non-believers may also find it of interest, an explanation of the fantasies men construct nightmares from.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m firmly in the James Madison camp of separating church and state. The former should never be mixed with the latter.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ok, this blog entry explores Greg Epstein&rsquo;s book, <em>Good Without God</em>. Before that, though, I thought I&rsquo;d share how I came to be reading a book about Humanism.</p>
<h2 id="morality-vs-religious-faith">Morality vs Religious Faith</h2>
<p>Living through COVID-19 pandemic, it&rsquo;s been curious to see the assault on reason that many &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; have launched. It may be that these believers are NOT believers, or that scientific reasoning and faith are not mutually exclusive (as those who fight against masking, vaccinations exemplify). After all, I believe and vaccinate/mask up. There are other questions, though. I ran across them in Phil Zuckerman&rsquo;s article in Salon, and they were intriguing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . .while most people assume that such a morality is grounded in religious faith, and while it is certainly true that all religions contain plenty of moral ideals, in our nation today, it is actually the most secular among us who are exhibiting a greater moral orientation — in the face of deadly threats — than the most devout among us, who are exhibiting the least.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before proceeding, let me make it clear: When I say the &ldquo;most secular among us,&rdquo; I mean atheists, agnostics, people who never attend religious services, don&rsquo;t think the Bible is the word of God, and don&rsquo;t pray. (Source: <strong><a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/08/21/staunch-atheists-show-higher-morals-than-the-proudly-pious-from-the-pandemic-to-climate-change/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Phil Zuckerman, Salon</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the article shares some interesting stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>80% of secular Americans accept the evidence that human activity is causing climate change</li>
<li>More Americans die annually from firearms than automobile accidents;</li>
<li>since 2009, there have been 255 mass shootings in the U.S.; every few hours, a child or teen dies from a gun wound.</li>
<li>55% of white Evangelicals are NOT in favor of banning guns</li>
</ul>
<p>The author continues with a laundry list of hot topics, asserting that for each, the &ldquo;most secular&rdquo; have a moral stance as opposed to religious. It all, of course, raises the question, &ldquo;Can people be good without having some Divine Being checking their evil?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For many people, including many atheists, the answer to Dostoevsky’s18 question “Without God … It means everything is permitted now, one can do anything?” is “Yes”, inasmuch as ‘every-thing’ refers to acts of extreme immorality.
Religions underpin large-scale intragroup cooperation3, but they also promote distrust of non-believers who are excluded from such religious moral communities. Does rising secularism moderate effects as atheist norms become stronger within societ-ies? The present findings suggest that intuitive moral suspicion of atheists is culturally widespread
(Source: <strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0151.epdf">Nature</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm. Is being moral limited to believers? It&rsquo;s obvious that the answer is, &ldquo;No. Unbelievers can be moral.&rdquo; You may as well ask, &ldquo;Can believers engage in scientific reasoning?&rdquo; Looking for some clarification, I found myself curious by Greg Epstein&rsquo;s selection as Harvard&rsquo;s chaplain. The guy must be a genius, no?</p>
<h2 id="good-without-god">Good without God</h2>
<p>When I saw that <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/us/harvard-chaplain-greg-epstein.html">Harvard had selected an atheist for its chaplain</a></strong>, I was intrigued. I mean, my idea of a chaplain is a priest or reverend or rabbi. Instead, Greg Epstein, author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SR2Q9G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Good without God</a></em>, was the man chosen for the job. The book&rsquo;s inside flap says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions about the role of God and religion in today&rsquo;s world have never been more relevant or felt more powerfully. Many of us are searching for a place where we can find not only facts and scientific reason but also hope and moral courage. For some, answers are found in the divine. For others, including the New Atheists, religion is an enemy.
But in <em>Good Without God</em>, Greg Epstein presents another, more balanced and inclusive response: Humanism. He highlights humanity&rsquo;s potential for goodness and the ways in which Humanists lead lives of purpose and compassion. Humanism can offer the sense of community we want and often need in good times and bad&ndash;and it teaches us that we can lead good and moral lives without the supernatural, without higher powers . . . without God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanists don’t deny the significance of God, but rather consider God to be the most influential literary character ever created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given <strong><a href="https://mguhlin.blogspot.com/2021/08/reflections-on-christianity-and-covid-19.html">recent reflections</a></strong>, I decided to pick up a copy and have found it a fascinating read.</p>

<h2 id="mynotes">MyNotes</h2>
<p>Here are my notes on Greg Epstein&rsquo;s book, <em>Good Without God</em>. Those notes capture key ideas that I simply had to organize to process well.</p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<ol>
<li>Over decades of polling, a majority of Americans have consistently indicated a negative opinion of atheists and nonbelievers.</li>
<li>One out of every two Americans admits to being prejudiced against fellow citizens who don&rsquo;t believe in God.</li>
<li>If we can convince ourselves today that one entire goup comprising millions of people might be incapable of goodness, then we harbor inside us the ability to turn against and hate any other group as well, and no one should feel safe.</li>
<li>Over a billion people around the world are nonreligious</li>
<li>In the United States, the nonreligious now represent approximately 15 percent of the population (approx 40 million Americans)</li>
<li>Nonreligious is the fastest growing religious preference in the US</li>
<li>Almost one in four American young adults today has no religion</li>
<li>If you identify as an atheist, agnostic, freethinker, rationalist, skeptic, cynic, secular humanist, naturalist, or deist; as spiritual, apathetic, nonreligious, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; or any other irreligious descriptive, you could probably count yourself a &ldquo;Humanist.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Joining the Humanist lifestance, you have company: Thomas Jefferson, John Lennon, Winston Churchhill, Margaret Sanger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Voltaire, David Human, Kurt Vonnegut, Einstein, and more</li>
<li>Humanism is being good without God. It warns: 1. we cannot wait until tomorrow or until the next life to be good because today is all we have 2. rejects dependence on faith, the supernatural, divine texts, resurrection, reincarnation, or anything else for which we have no evidence</li>
<li>Humanism is a progressive lifestance, without supernaturalism, affirming our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment, aspiring to the greater good of humanity</li>
<li>Most religion is not about an all-seeing deity with a baritone voice and a flowing beard. It is about group identification&ndash;the community and the connections we need to live. It is about family, tradition, consolation, ethics, memories, music, art, architecture, and much more. Outside traditional forms of religious affiliation or custom, it is hard to find these.</li>
<li>Humanism is more of a philosophy, a lifestance, rather than a divine or revealed religion</li>
<li>While nonreligious people often value science highly, many deeply religious people value and study it as well. So surely valuing science cannot be a way to distinguish religious people from nonreligious people.  15. Science can teach us a great deal, like what medicine to give to patients in a hospital. But science won&rsquo;t come and visit us in the hospital.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-one-can-we-be-good-without-god">Chapter One: Can We Be Good Without God</h2>
<ol>
<li>All the evidence suggests that creation narratives like that found in Genesis are neither literally true nor divinely inspired metaphors but simply the first flawed human attempts to answer questions for which we now have much better answers.</li>
<li>The scientific method, while imperfect, is the most reliable tool human beings have ever known for determining the nature of the world around us. 3. What do you believe about God?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Humanist answer: We (the nonreligious, atheists, Humanists, etc.) believe that God is the most important, influential literary character human beings have ever created.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Different kinds of atheism:
*Ontological atheism: a firm denial that there is any creator or manager of the universe</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ethical atheism: a firm conviction that even if there is a creator/manager of the world, he does not run things in accordance with the human moral agenda, rewarding the good and punishing the wicked</li>
<li>Existential atheism: even if there is a God, he has no authority to be the boss of my life</li>
<li>Agnostic atheism: a cautious denial that claims God&rsquo;s existence can neither be proved nor disproved</li>
<li>Ignostic atheism: another cautious denial that claims the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; is so confusing it is meaningless</li>
<li>Pragmatic atheism: God is irrelevant to ethical and successful living, and views all discussions about God as a waste of time.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Why are people naturally good?</li>
<li>The Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The idea that people, like prisoners attempting to escape a jail cell, are constantly faced with decisions about whether to cooperate with one another or whether to defect</li>
<li>Sometimes rationality is not so rational. There is a donor, who pays a cost in order to cooperate, and a potential recipient, who gets a benefit from the donor&rsquo;s cost</li>
<li>More sophisticated players learn that in the long run, giving and getting can occasionally be a win-win strategy.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re all objectively demonstrably better off when aiming for cooperation than when aiming for selfishness</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>Neural complexity:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Humans have evolved a complex enough ability to think that we can recognize what is called &ldquo;the interchangeability of perspectives.&rdquo;</li>
<li>That is, if I want you do something for me, I have to be able to take your interests into account as well, unless I am a &ldquo;galactic overlord&rdquo; or am not interested in a particularly high rate of success</li>
<li>This is the key insight of the Golden Rule</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>Five rules of cooperation:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Kin selection: The mysterious pull we often feel to love, nurture, and come to the aid of members of our own family.</li>
<li>Direct reciprocity: You feel motivated to help others because they can help you.</li>
<li>Indirect reciprocity (pay it forward): I help you, somebody else will help me. It feels good to give to others, whether we get back or not.</li>
<li>Network reciprocity: Groups or networks like churches, temples are examples of unselfish human cooperation. We form these networks because we evolved to. People need community.</li>
<li>Group selection: The idea that sometimes individuals may sacrifice their own personal success and yet still &ldquo;win&rdquo; if members of their group have success against members of other groups.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>Humanism rejects &ldquo;Social Darwinism.&rdquo; Our job as Humanists is not to minimize the role selfishness and brutality have played in human history.</li>
<li>Humanism is the active choice that, whenever possible, dignity get priority. It means acknowledging and understanding our selfish genes precisely so that we can continue to evolve beyond them.</li>
<li>Ethical values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience. Humanists ground values in human welfare shaped by human circumstances, interests, and concerns, and extended to the global ecosystem and beyond. We are committed to treating each person as having inherent worth and dignity, and to making informed choices in a context of freedom consonant with responsibility&quot; (<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_Manifesto">Humanist Manifesto</a></strong>).</li>
<li>If no morality is timeless and eternal, then we will never be able to fool ourselves into thinking that there is one set of easy and obvious answers to questions about euthanasia, abortion, capital punishment, or other such issues. We&rsquo;ll have to argue them out.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-two-a-brief-history-of-goodness-without-god-or-a-short-campus-tour-of-the-university-of-humanism">Chapter Two: A Brief History of Goodness Without God, or a Short Campus Tour of the University of Humanism</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rig Veda: &ldquo;Who really knows? Whence is this creation? The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen? Perhaps the universe formed itself. Perhaps not&ndash;the one who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he knows. Or perhaps he does not know.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lokayata and Carvaka: No one has ever been able to prove that he or she has witnessed a miracle. No man or woman has ever risen from the dead. No god has ever appeared on earth to explain how or why he created the basic elements that seem upon any careful, serious examination of the facts to be all we have and all we are. And those who beg and berate us to believe&ndash;that is, to believe the unbelievable&ndash;almost always have their own self-serving agenda.</li>
<li>Epicurus: &ldquo;Nothing to fear in God; Nothing to feel in Death; Good can be attained; Evil can be endured.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Epicurus declared the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Examine all that we do</li>
<li>Examine all we choose to love and value</li>
<li>Choose that which is worth choosing (which produces happiness)</li>
<li>Jains: &ldquo;If God created the world, where was he before creation? If you say he was transcendent then, and needed no support, where is he now? No single being had the skill to make this world&ndash;for how can an immaterial god create that which is material?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Deim: there may have been a God who created the universe, but that this God did not appear to interact with the world other than by assigning nature&rsquo;s laws; therefore miracles such as the virgin birth, resurrection, or the trinity were impossible.</li>
<li>Thomas Jefferson: All people are equally deserving of an opportunity to pursue happiness and to be free of suffering in this life (rather than redeemed by it in the next life)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<ol>
<li>Humanism is an acknowledgement that a meaningful life is by definition a moral life, and a moral life is by definition a meaningful life.</li>
<li>Morality is not about sinners and saints, heaven and hell, damnation and punishment.</li>
<li>Morality IS about alleviating unnecessary suffering and promoting human flourishing, or dignity.</li>
<li>&hellip;if you believe God is nature, or love, or the universe, do you really think there to be any difference in your belief system and Humanism?</li>
<li>There are those who are truly motivated to be good by terror of God&rsquo;s supernatural punishment and hope for his miraculous rewards. But maybe if you are among the many millions who don&rsquo;t literally believe in heaven or hell, then you too are a Humanist&hellip;you will have to choose a purpose based mainly on how you as a human being should relate to other humans beings in this world, for the sake of this world. Just as Humanists do. [compelling argument]</li>
<li>Many people claim that Humanism or atheism is nihilism and vice versa. This assertion is either unconscionable, incredibly ignorant, or both.</li>
<li>Types of nihilism:</li>

<ul>
<li>Four Qualities:</li>
<li>The first is high self-awareness, a heightened sense of personal identity and individual reality.</li>
<li>A willingness to assume responsibility for one&rsquo;s own life and to avoid surrendering that responsibility to any other person or institution.</li>
<li>The third is a refusal to find one&rsquo;s identity in any possession.</li>
<li>The fourth is the sense that one&rsquo;s behavior is worthy of imitation by others</li>
<li>Moral Obligations</li>
<li>I have a moral obligation to strive for greater mastery and control over my own life.</li>
<li>I have a moral obligation to be reliable and trustworthy.</li>
<li>I have a moral obligation to be generous.</li>

<li>&ldquo;Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. Some of the conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of meaning and purpose will emerge&rdquo; (adapted from Erich Fromm by Greg Epstein)</li>
<li>There is a state in which you&rsquo;re aware of your own humanity, and you&rsquo;re also aware of others' humanity, and you&rsquo;re aware that all human beings are human. There&rsquo;s a state in which you&rsquo;re aware of your own vulnerability and mortality, and that awareness allows you to connect with others from a place of strength and empowerment. There&rsquo;s a state in which you don&rsquo;t have too much clingy connection or too much lonely disconnection, but where you combine self and other. Being in this state feels good in both the short term and long term&ndash;good enough to motivate us strongly. And so our goal is to get there and try to stay there. 18.

<h2 id="quick-reflection">Quick Reflection</h2>
<p>Sherwin Wine&rsquo;s four qualities and three obligations that compose human dignity and human being&rsquo;s ongoing quest to personify them are quite impressive. In fact, they are common to many belief systems and capture the essence of dignity. I definitely think anyone could adopt these for their own, regardless of belief.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I read about Rabbi Hillel in my college years. The assertion made at the time was that Jesus was the only one to phrase The Golden Rule in positive terms. That is, &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&rdquo;</p>

<li>Without any conflict, human life is tedious.</li>
<li>Humanism&rsquo;s basic focus is about engaging with life, acknowledging the reality of aging, sickness, death, and other problems so that we can learn to most fully appreciate the time, health, and life we have.</li>
<li>Essentially all the world&rsquo;s religions were founded on the principle that divine beings or forces can promise a level of justice in a supernatural realm that cannot be perceived in this natural one.</li>

<li>Beyond ritual, what is the role of culture more boadly in religion and Humanism? How should we understand the relationship between belief in God and religious affiliation? We&rsquo;ve seen how many good arguments there are against belief in God. But remove religious affiliation, and for most people, you also strip away their sense of connection to their unique ancestry, heritage, memory, and identity. Is the sacrifice worthwhile?</li>

			 <p>Thanks to Stephanie DeYoung, I had a chance to see again how history is hidden. Like the person in the video at the top of the Wakelet shown below, I was ignorant of my U.S. history. I can claim it as a descendant of Norwegian immigrants. We are all ignorant of our history, there should be little surpise at it. But, like the person in the video embedded in the Wakelet collection below, I found myself asking, &ldquo;How did this happen?&rdquo; Who couldn&rsquo;t help but be a bit self-reproachful?</p>
<h2 id="making-children-feel-bad-no">Making Children Feel Bad? No.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about making you feel bad, it&rsquo;s about allowing truths long smothered, buried, hidden to come to the surface. Think of when a lie that has held you prisoner is shown wrong. What relief. Now imagine that lie bathed in blood of your people, your ancestors, people you didn&rsquo;t even realize had been enslaved, or maybe, that you did.</p>
<p>Clint Smith refers to this as &ldquo;discovered ignorance.&rdquo; You end up asking yourself questions&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How could this have happened and I didn&rsquo;t know about it? How could that happen?&quot;</strong> (Source: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/09/periphery-of-memory-mynotes-word-word.html">Clint Smith, <em>How the Word is Passed</em></a>)</strong>
<strong><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/condoleezza-rice-says-white-kids-180000492.html">Watching a recorded video of Condoleeza Rice on <em>The View</em> on Wednesday, 10/20/2021</a></strong>, I was struck by this idea that she sees critical race theory as a way to make little white children feel bad.
“The way we’re talking about race is that it either seems so big that somehow white people now have to feel guilty for everything that happened in the past,” said Rice.</p>
<p>Rice continued that she didn’t feel this approach was to the benefit of anyone.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s very productive or Black people feel disempowered by race. I would like Black kids to be completely empowered to know they are beautiful in their Blackness, but in order to do that, I don’t have to make white kids feel bad for being white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presumes people in the present are now blameless, fully aware of their history. But that&rsquo;s the problem. Some don&rsquo;t know the history. It&rsquo;s been distorted, omitted, and most are ignorant. It makes me wonder, are people of color the only ones who should be traumatized by the truth, or should everyone be traumatized by it because it happened? Of course, there are some who DO know and have worked actively to keep it hidden.</p>
<h2 id="is-anger-justified">Is Anger Justified?</h2>
<p>As someone of Norwegian (Swedish) and LatinX (Panamanian/Spanish) ancestry, I feel angry that history books lied and omitted the truth about what happened. As a child, I know I would have been horrified, traumatized by what happened. But a middle school or high school me would have been able to better understand. And, given what happened, every human child should be made to know what happened, not just those whose families suffered and remembered.</p>
<p>Genocides should have that effect on us. Whether it&rsquo;s the Holocaust, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak">Arawak natives being eradicated</a></strong> by gold hungry, well-armed, diseased Europeans (hey, it&rsquo;s in the histories), Kosovo genocide, Los desaparecidos, those stories should compel us to action&hellip;if only to give as true an account as possible of what happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As non-Indigenous people, we have the hard task of unlearning generations of massaged truths and outright lies to uncover the real truth, so we can properly begin and continue reconciliation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Canadian (and US) school systems heavily cleansed Indigenous history. If Indigenous history is brought up at all, white settlers are frequently painted as kind, generous traders. Similarly, Indigenous tribes are presented as passive, happy “natives” eager to trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is unfortunately much more gruesome&hellip; there are a lot of facts merely swept under the rug by Western ideology. This is not about pushing guilt or making you sad. It’s about learning the key facts to better understand why truth and reconciliation is so important.

<h2 id="my-history">My History</h2>
<p>As a little boy of privilege growing up in Panama, who could speak the language of power (English) and the language of family (Spanish), I should have known&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/vikings-were-in-north-america-by-1021-ce/">Vikings got to America in 1021</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/ancient-solar-storm-pinpoints-viking-settlement-americas-exactly-1000-years-ago">long before Columbus did</a></strong></li>
<li>Urraca fought off Bartholomew Columbus for nine years while his people, the ancestors of the region of Panama my mother and family is from, were killed and enslaved</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me">Columbus and his cronies raided, mutilated, raped, murdered, and stole for Spain</a>.</strong> They did it for GOLD, for SLAVES, and engaged in a campaign of genocide against indigenous peoples</li>
<li>The British, the French, all joined in on the <strong><a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org">Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade</a></strong> and</li>

</ul>
<p>When you read or see the real histories, you can&rsquo;t help but be disgusted and ashamed by what happened. But it is what happened, events over which one has no control now. It&rsquo;s not like we could go back in time and tell Europeans, &ldquo;Hey, what you&rsquo;re going to do to a continent full of people is wrong, and that&rsquo;s not allowable.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="alternate-history">Alternate History?</h2>

<h2 id="get-over-it-already">Get Over It, Already!</h2>
<p>The more I read, the more irritated I get. As a person whose grandparents are Swedish immigrants to America, as white as can be, I don&rsquo;t feel personally responsible about history. What I get angry about is the fact that history textbook authors and companies conspired to LIE to generations of Americans about WHAT HAPPENED. And, that it took me so long to realize that.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m old, it seems pointless to get mad that I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Question everything,&rdquo; as one of the people interviewed in Clint Smith&rsquo;s book recommended. You can&rsquo;t stay angry. You can&rsquo;t feel bad forever. You have to accept that alongside the fictions and nonfictions, there is good and evil, crammed together in the hold of the ship.</p>
<p>Instead, you have to shine a light on the dark spaces, hidden from sight for so long. You have to offer others conflicting accounts of what happened, and invite them to change. You have to demand that those in power, who are actively working to cover things up, stop, even when it means they might lose everything.</p>

<h2 id="critically-examining-history">Critically Examining History</h2>
<p>When you consider that knowing WHAT happened as a result of Europeans subjugating, enslaving people of color, is so horrific (it is), then you have to stop and ask, &ldquo;Do I want my children to learn this part of our heritage? A heritage of oppression and destruction, of genocide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer is, &ldquo;Yes, you bet. I don&rsquo;t want my children to grow up NOT knowing their heritage includes murder, mayhem, and genocide.&rdquo; But, we aren&rsquo;t those people. That is, we aren&rsquo;t those people if we decide not to perpetuate the attitudes that hold we are better than others simply because we are white. Or, that we deserve more because of where we came from.</p>
<p>When Columbus landed on the shores of any place, he claimed it. By what right? Force of arms. It&rsquo;s no wonder that &ldquo;God&rdquo; is cited so often in the words of Spain. Consider this excerpt from Clint Smith&rsquo;s book of how Spain handled things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I implore you to recognize the Church as a lady and in the name of the Pope take the King as lord of this land and obey his mandates. If you do not do it, I tell you that with the help of God I will enter powerfully against you all. I will make war everywhere and every way that I can. I will subject you to the yoke and obedience to the Church and to his majesty. I will take your women and children and make them slaves&hellip;the deaths and injuries that you will receive from here on will be your own fault and not that of his majesty nor of the gentlemen that accompany me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clint Smith remarks about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having thus satisfied their consciences by offering the Indians a chance to convert to Christianity, the Spaniards then felt free to do what they wanted with the people they had just &ldquo;discovered.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mention this because if we could look around and say, &ldquo;None of that brutality endures today, we&rsquo;re different people,&rdquo; we might be able to claim innocence. But we can&rsquo;t. You have only to look at how Black people have been murdered, beaten, paralyzed, slain in their sleep, to realize that a society that condones this, that never launches an investigation, is carrying on today what Spaniards and other Europeans did upon arriving in America.</p>
<p>Would we all be better off if Europeans hadn&rsquo;t landed on a richly populated land, then done horrible things to its peoples? I would like to think so.</p>
<h2 id="evangelical-christianity">Evangelical Christianity</h2>
<p>This morning, before I began my day, I read <strong><a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/10/19/religion-scholar-anthea-butler-on-white-christianity-and-its-role-in-fueling-fascism/">this Salon piece</a></strong> by Chauncey Devega. Before she brings on the interview with the author of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/white-evangelical-racism-the-politics-of-morality-in-america/9781469661179">White Evangelical Racism</a></em> (Anthea Butler), she makes this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Age of Trump, movement conservatism has metastasized or devolved into its purest form: American fascism, a form of religious politics taken to its most illogical extreme. Facts, truth and even the conception of reality itself are being replaced with lies, fictions, and fantasies that serve the American fascist movement and its leader.</p>
<p>As public opinion polls and other research have repeatedly shown, white right-wing Christians, especially Protestant evangelicals, have pledged their loyalty to Donald Trump and his movement. Many view him as a literal prophet or savior: His evident immorality has been rationalized as somehow necessary to his prophetic role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2016, I remember asking myself, &ldquo;How could anyone support someone who says and does those things?&rdquo; Now, as I re-read these words in the dark of night, I realize that this brand of weaponized religion is no different than the words of the Spaniards as they prepared to take what they wanted.</p>
<p>But there is a difference, now, isn&rsquo;t there? Now, the people of color have access to a lesson they had not learned well enough to defend themselves in 1492. They have an idea of how to best defend against religious fanatics who want to take whatever they want because they believe it is their right to do so.</p>
<p>If only we could find a way to tell the truth of what happened, reconcile, and move forward. But it is an unending struggle&hellip;millions dead, fresh blood added every season.</p>
<h2 id="rigorous-adherence-to-the-truth">Rigorous Adherence to the Truth</h2>
<p>Every human being struggles with the truth. Often, it is truth that is hidden from you, or truth that you have obscured to save yourself pain. Or truth you have buried because it is too horrible to contemplate. If we have a shovel to dig ourselves out from the pain truth brings, it is kindness and love innate to us, as much as the desire to do whatever is necessary to possess and dominate.</p>
<p>How would things change if those of European descent said, &ldquo;Yes, we realize horrible things were done. Yes, we benefited, and continue to today, from all that happened. Let&rsquo;s go down that road together. If I am penniless, dead by your vengeful hand, at least, I know that I did what was right in acknowledging my complicity in oppressing others today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, I have trouble with believing that&rsquo;s possible. But <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHhbeRJudY4">some say, &ldquo;Yes, we can.</a>&quot;</strong></p>

			 <p>As I take the time to read the history of my Panamanian roots, I realize how much I don&rsquo;t know. But I do have threads to cling to, that I can grasp and pull greater truths closer. One of the words my mother told me of as a child as that of &ldquo;The Guaymí.&rdquo; I never understood what the word meant, only that it referred to the people that were a part of my Panamanian family, albeit those that looked less like Spaniards and more like the native population stamped out by the Spanish. Those were the broad strokes of history, no details more.</p>
<p>I often heard my mother share how proud she was of this university in the heart of Panama&rsquo;s Veraguas region&hellip;</p>
<p>A picture of Urraca in Santiago de Veraguas, which I took in 2007 when I visited with my mother. She graduated from this school as a teacher at nineteen years of age.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when I read the following, I found myself thinking, &ldquo;Ignorant of history and culture&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ngobe traditionally referred to themselves as the Guaymí– a term that simply means “people” in the Ngäbe language. The term is infrequently used today. More often, the Ngobe are referred to as Ngöbe Buglé—this is a union of the Ngobe (Ngöbe) and the Bokota (Buglé) Peoples who live together in the Ngöbe–Buglé Comarca (an indigenous province that signifies a high degree of administrative autonomy).</p>
<p>Although both Indigenous Peoples are closely associated, the Ngäbe and Buglé are two separate linguistic/indigenous groups whose languages are mutually unintelligible. Collectively, these two groups make up the largest indigenous population in Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Santiago de Veraguas, where my mother grew up, the name of Urraca was mentioned often. In fact, when I visited in 2007, a year after my father died, my mother took me to the university where she had been certified as a teacher in Panama. In the middle of the square in front of the school stands a statue, homage to Urraca. The history&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Urracá or Ubarragá Maniá Tigrí (d. 1531) was an Ngäbe Amerindian chieftain or cacique in the region of present-day Panama who fought effectively against the Spanish conquistadors. Captured at one point, Urracá managed to escape a ship bound for Spain and rejoin his people.</p>
<p>He continued to lead the fight against the Spanish until he was killed in battle in 1531.[1] He is remembered as el caudillo amerindio de Veragua (the Amerind leader of Veragua) and adversary of the Spanish Empire), the great resistance leader of Panama. He has been honored by his image on the centesimo, the smallest-denomination coin of Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting is&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>El Quibían, or Quibían, was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples">indigenous</a> king who ruled lands in the river basins of Quiebra and Yebra, now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belen_River">Rio Belén</a>, on the Caribbean coast of the present day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panam%C3%A1">Panamá</a>, who was visited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus#Fourth_voyage">fourth voyage</a>, in early 1503. He is mentioned in documents of Columbus' voyage with the name &ldquo;El Quibían&rdquo; or Quibían.</p>
<p>As he is always identified with the prefix article, it is very possible that the word Quibían identifies a title, namely that of chief among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaymi">Ngöbe</a> peoples. It is widely suggested by historians like Joaquin Gonzalez that this means el Quibían was, in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urrac%C3%A1">Urracá</a>, a Ngöbe cacique who successfully united a number of tribes to defend his people in present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veraguas">Veraguas</a> against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistadors">conquistadors</a>, starting in 1519.</p>
<p>Gonzalez suggests it because of the similar descriptions of the two leaders, their ability to organize neighboring tribes, and their ability to defeat the Spanish. (<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urrac%C3%A1">source</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great organizer and rebel against the conquistadors. As a child, I would boast. My boast of being descended from conquistadores and vikings (from my father) left out the heritage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urrac%C3%A1">Urracá</a>. It makes you wonder why I didn&rsquo;t learn more of my heritage as a youngster. Instead, I learned about United States history (false as some parts were, or incomplete at best). This was intentional.</p>
<p>No doubt, every boy who can claim grandparents, or parents, from Veraguas says, &ldquo;I am descended from the great Urraca.&rdquo; Why should I be any different? What&rsquo;s important, the defiance in the face of injustice, tyranny, murder, rape.</p>
<p>:-(</p>
<p>I had never heard this history, this possible connection between Urraca and <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/09/ancient-revelations.html">Columbus</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quibían, who was suspicious of the Columbus brothers, told them not to go past a certain point in the river. When they did, he began secretly planning with several indigenous nations to destroy the settlement and expel the foreigners.</p>
<p>Aware of these plans [of rebellion], Bartholomew Columbus captured the king, his family and friends, who he led tied up to Santa María. El Quibían tricked them into throwing him from the boat, into the river, and the Spanish assumed that since he was tied up, he would drown. The Spanish ships left the river and anchored a short distance from the coast, but while Bartholomew was on board to receive instructions from Christopher Columbus, el Quibían, who had managed to escape and gather some of the neighboring nations, attacked Santa María.</p>
<p>There was a battle, in which Bartholomew Columbus was wounded, and el Quibían defeated the Spanish. Finally, the Spanish had to abandon their settlement and flee. On the ships, some of the relatives and friends of el Quibían tried to flee, but those who did not make it were hanged in the hold of the ship where they had been held.

<p>It&rsquo;s incredible to read this and realize that your ancestors fought against Columbus. No doubt, there is some native blood that carried through to current generations. The unfortunate truth is, for my family, given the whiteness of the skin, the heritage is more Spanish than anything else. My mother was considered &ldquo;trigueña,&rdquo; that is, between two colors, &ldquo;black&rdquo; and white.</p>
<p>As I read Chapter 4 of <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/search/label/Hammond">Zaretta Hammond&rsquo;s book</a></strong>, where she suggests growing one&rsquo;s awareness&hellip;as I read more history, the more depressing to see the artifice and lies, the oppression and brutality.</p>
<p>Essentially, 20% of the world conquered the other 80%. Then, set up a system of oppression that endures to this day. Some might argue, that is humanity&rsquo;s greatest achievement (or tragedy).</p>
<p>No matter what one&rsquo;s heritage, it is reprehensible. I&rsquo;ve read you shouldn&rsquo;t judge the past by the present. But when systems of oppression endure into the present, then we must. Now you see how self-serving, &ldquo;judge not lest ye be judged&rdquo; is for the religion of the oppressors.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How could this have happened and I didn&rsquo;t know about it? How could that happen?&quot;</strong> This is, as <strong><a href="https://www.mguhlin.org/2021/09/periphery-of-memory-mynotes-word-word.html">Clint Smith refers to it in his book</a></strong>, &ldquo;discovered ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
